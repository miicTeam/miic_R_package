Title: Learning Causal or Non-Causal Graphical Models Using Information
        Theory
Version: 1.4.2
Date: 2020-07-27
Package: miic
Description: We report an information-theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. This approach can be applied on a wide range of datasets and provide new biological insights on regulatory networks from single cell expression data, genomic alterations during tumor development and co-evolving residues in protein structures.
