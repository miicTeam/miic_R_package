Description: We report an information-theoretic method which learns a large
    class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational
    data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly
    found in many datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method
    iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information
    contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences
    from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented
    based on the signature of causality in observational data. This approach can
    be applied on a wide range of datasets and provide new biological insights
    on regulatory networks from single cell expression data, genomic alterations
    during tumor development and co-evolving residues in protein structures.
    Since the version 2.0, MIIC can in addition process stationary time series 
    to unveil temporal causal graphs.
