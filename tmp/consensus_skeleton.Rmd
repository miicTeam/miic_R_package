# Robustness analysis
The goal of this feature is to evaluate the effect of small variations in the sample used as input to the MIIC algorithm, so that we can measure its robustness to such events.

# Proposed solution
One way to do such analysis is by resampling the original sample $N$ (nSkeletons) times and inferring a skeleton for each of these resamples. Then, the idea is to create a _consensus skeleton_ based on all the inferred skeletons and compare it to the final network, inferred with the original sample. The _consensus skeleton_ is made of all edges that were present in at least $N\%$ (doConsensus) of the skeletons inferred from the resamplings

# Resampling methods
There are several resampling methods, as one can see in the figure below. For now, there are two methods implemented in MIIC: [Bootstraping](#bootstraping) and [jackknife](#jackknife).

```{r resampling_methods, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Resampling with different methods. Taken from an [StackOverflow answer](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/104040/resampling-simulation-methods-monte-carlo-bootstrapping-jackknifing-cross). The networks above are [random](https://rpubs.com/lgadar/generate-graphs) and were used with the parameter for explanatory purposes.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/resampling methods.jpg")
```

## Bootstraping {#bootstraping}
Bootstraping generally refers to any resampling method that does resamples with replacement. This implies that some samples may not occur at all in the resample, while others may occurr more than once. The boostrap method for the consensus skeleton in MIIC works by taking $N$ (nSkeletons) resamplings with replacement.

## Jackknife {#jackknife}
Jackknife is a resampling method, without replacement, that does undersampling. One example would be to randomly choose 8 out of 10 samples, meaning a fraction of 80%. 

So far, jackknife has been chosen as the resampling method so the proposed solution goes as the following figure:

```{r workflow_consensus_network, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Workflow to obtain the consensus network. Can be edited [here](https://www.draw.io/#G10BA0KiEFZl_YpKh6mIv2WlOP6cRgdyp0)", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/workflow_consensus_network.png")
```

# Test dataset
Our proposed solution will be applied to binarized expression data of 33 transcription factors involved in early differentiation of primitive erythroid and endothelial cells (3934 cells). This dataset comes by default in the miic R package.

# Examples
In our example, let's use the _hematoData_ data package contained in the MIIC R package and build the consensus skeleton through 10 and 100 skeletons inferred from resamples.

## N=10
```{r}
library(miic)
data(hematoData)
nske = 10
```

### By bootstrapping
The consensus skeleton will be made of edges that are present in $80\%$ of the skeletons.
```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2019)
miic.res = miic(inputData = hematoData, latent = TRUE, confidenceShuffle = 10,
                confidenceThreshold = 0.001,
                doConsensus = 80,
                nSkeletons = nske)
```

### By jackknife
The consensus skeleton will be made of edges that are present in $80\%$ of the skeletons, and the resampling will be done randomly from $90\%$
of the original sample.
```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2019)
miic.res = miic(inputData = hematoData, latent = TRUE, confidenceShuffle = 10,
                confidenceThreshold = 0.001,

# Evaluating parameters
The idea is to evaluate the parameters used for the resampling approach. These parameters are the number of skeletons to build the consensus skeleton, the minimum occurrence of an edge in these skeletons to be included in the consensus skeleton and the proportion of the original data to be randomly undersampled to be given as input for each skeleton.

There is no point in having very small steps, such as consensus from 1 to 100, one by one. The differences, keeping other parameters still, would be very small to realize. Mostly noise. Besides, the amount of time to run these three loops would take a hueg amount of time. This way, I decided to have larger steps.

## Jackknife
I initially tried to do everything in RStudio but at every iteration the amount of RAM was growing absurdly, even if not keeping any data from the previous iteration (except counters, that is, i,j and k). A solution for that was to write an R script and a shell script that would call the former iteratively.

### With edge filtering
The R script code is shown below:

    done
  done
done
```

With both files in the same file directory, the following command line should be run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
./call_robustness_evaluation.sh
```

#### Analysis of results

One way of visualize the result is through a scatter plot, where every dot is a simulation in a 3D-plot where X=nSkeletons, Y=Consensus and Z=Fraction. The edge will also be colored according to the accuracy between the consensus skeleton and the final skeleton.

The code below is only run in RStudio.
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(plot3Drgl)

setwd('tmp/figs/loops/')
df <- as_tibble(read.csv2(file = 'percent_similarity.txt', sep = ',',
                          header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
colnames(df) <- c('accuracy', 'consensus', 'nskeleton', 'fraction')
df$accuracy <- as.numeric(df$accuracy)

library(plot3D)

scatter3D(x = df$nskeleton, z = df$consensus, y = df$fraction,
          colvar = df$accuracy, clab = c("Accuracy"), pch = 19,
          ticktype = "detailed",
          bty = "b2", phi = 0, ylim=c(1,100), zlim=c(1,100),
          xlim=c(1,100), zlab = c('% Consensus'), ylab = c('% fraction used'),
          xlab = c('nSkeletons')
          ) # try also without specifying phi
# 3d interactive plot locally
plotrgl()
```

```{r output_local_3D_wo_ef, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="3D plot of the simulation", out.width = '100%'}

One way of visualize the result is through a scatter plot, where every dot is a simulation in a 3D-plot where X=nSkeletons, Y=Consensus and Z=Fraction. The edge will also be colored according to the accuracy between the consensus skeleton and the final skeleton.

The code below is only run in RStudio.
```{r eval=FALSE}

          xlab = c('nSkeletons')
          ) # try also without specifying phi
# 3d interactive plot locally
plotrgl()
```

```{r output_local_3D, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="3D plot of the simulation", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/figs/3D_output_default_w_ef.png")

      Rscript robustness_evaluation.R -n $j -c $i -f $k -s 2019 -d "/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/figs/loops/only_resamplings"
    done
  done
done
```

With both files in the same file directory, the following command line should be run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
./call_robustness_evaluation.sh
```

#### Analysis of results

One way of visualize the result is through a scatter plot, where every dot is a simulation in a 3D-plot where X=nSkeletons, Y=Consensus and Z=Fraction. The edge will also be colored according to the accuracy between the consensus skeleton and the final skeleton.

The code below is only run in RStudio.
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(plot3Drgl)

setwd('/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/figs/loops/only_resamplings/')
df <- as_tibble(read.csv2(file = 'percent_similarity.txt', sep = ',',
                          header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
colnames(df) <- c('accuracy', 'consensus', 'nskeleton', 'fraction')
df$accuracy <- as.numeric(df$accuracy)

library(plot3D)

scatter3D(x = df$nskeleton, z = df$consensus, y = df$fraction,
          colvar = df$accuracy, clab = c("Accuracy"), pch = 19,
          ticktype = "detailed",
          bty = "b2", phi = 0, ylim=c(1,100), zlim=c(1,100),
          xlim=c(1,100), zlab = c('% Consensus'), ylab = c('% fraction used'),
          xlab = c('nSkeletons')
          ) # try also without specifying phi
# 3d interactive plot locally
plotrgl()
```

```{r output_local_3D_ef_rds, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="3D plot of the simulation", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/figs/3D_output_default_w_ef_rds.png")
```

This code produces the 3D interactive plot in this report.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(threejs)
library(dplyr)

setwd('/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/figs/loops/wo_edge_filtering/')
df <- as_tibble(read.csv2(file = 'percent_similarity.txt', sep = ',',
                          header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE))
colnames(df) <- c('accuracy', 'consensus', 'nskeleton', 'fraction')
df$accuracy <- as.numeric(df$accuracy)

scatterplot3js(x = df$nskeleton, z = df$consensus, y = df$fraction,
               color = rainbow(length(df$accuracy)), main=paste("Hover mouse",
               " over dots to check accuraccy"),
               labels=as.character(df$accuracy),
               xlim=c(10,100),
               ylim=c(10,100),
               zlim=c(10,100),
               size=0.5)
```

How much does accuracy vary through these parameters?
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

nskeletons_min <- df %>%
  filter(nskeleton == min(df$nskeleton)) %>%
  summarise(min = min(accuracy), max = max(accuracy))
nskeletons_max <- df %>%
  filter(nskeleton == max(df$nskeleton)) %>%
  summarise(min = min(accuracy), max = max(accuracy))
diff <- nskeletons_max - nskeletons_min
colnames(diff) <- c('diff in min (nskeletons)', 'diff in max (nskeletons)')
abs(diff)

fraction_min <- df %>%
  filter(fraction == min(df$fraction)) %>%
  summarise(min = min(accuracy), max = max(accuracy))
fraction_max <- df %>%
  filter(fraction == max(df$fraction)) %>%
  summarise(min = min(accuracy), max = max(accuracy))
diff <- fraction_max - fraction_min
colnames(diff) <- c('diff in min (fraction)', 'diff in max (fraction)')

  summarise(min = min(accuracy), max = max(accuracy))
diff <- consensus_max - consensus_min
colnames(diff) <- c('diff in min (consensus)', 'diff in max (consensus)')
abs(diff)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(dplyr)

df <- matrix(c(6.097561, 0), ncol = 2, nrow = 1)
colnames(df) <- c('diff in min (nskeletons)', 'diff in max (nskeletons)')

# Benchmarking

The goal of this section is to apply MIIC in two different ways to data whose real network is known. I will first run MIIC with edge filtering and then MIIC with the consensus skeleton and measure which one got closer to the real network through the F-score metric. We will start with the [ALARM](http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-medium.html#alarm) network, then try with the [INSURANCE](http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-medium.html#insurance) network which is a bit more complicated and then finally with the [BARLEY](http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-medium.html#barley) network which is the most complicated of the three networks. The more parameters (number of possible values in the variables), the bigger the sample size required to have a representative understanding of the scenario. All the data and network information was obtained from [here](http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/).

In order to generate samples, one must download the BIF object from the link above related to the chosen network. Then, run the code below, providing the number of samples (n parameter) you wish to generate (based on probability/metada information contained in the BIF object).

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(bnlearn)

setwd('/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/data/real_networks/ALARM/')
myBnNet = read.bif(file='alarm.bif', debug = FALSE)
# Generate 1000 samples
myDataNet = try(rbn(myBnNet, n=1000, debug = F))
```

You can also plot the real network by using the R snippet below.
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(bnlearn)

setwd('/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/data/real_networks/INSURANCE/')
myBnNet = read.bif(file='insurance.bif', debug = FALSE)

plot(bn.net(myBnNet))
```

A better version of the network can be obtained in the [bnlearn website](http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-medium.html#alarm) and is shown below.

```{r insurance_real_network, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/alarm_network.png")
```

One can also check what is the markov blanket of a node X in a markov random field, that is, all nodes that are immediately associated with the node X.
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(bnlearn)

setwd('/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/data/real_networks/ALARM/')
myBnNet = read.bif(file='alarm.bif', debug = FALSE)

network <- bn.net(myBnNet)
# Markov blanket of the node CATECHOL (CCHL in the network)
print(c(network$nodes$CATECHOL$parents, network$nodes$CATECHOL$children))
```

In order to perform the simulations, I wrote a benchmark script (benchmark.R) whose code is shown below. I generated three cohorts for each of the three datasets. One with 100 samples, 1000 samples and 10,000 samples. Each simulation was run with confidence parameters from 50 to 100 (50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100) and fraction parameters from 80 to 95 (80, 85, 90, 95) with a total of 24 simulations per sample size, 24x3 per dataset totalling 216 simulations for the three datasets. Confidence is how often among the resampling skeletons an edge must occur to be added to the consensus skeleton and fraction is the proportion of the undersampling from the original dataset.

              metavar="integer")
);

opt_parser = OptionParser(option_list=option_list);
opt = parse_args(opt_parser);

# Calling code with handled arguments
benchmark(nSkeletons = opt$nSkeletons,
          consensus = opt$consensus,
          fraction = opt$fraction,
          seed = opt$seed,
          edgeFiltering = opt$edge_filtering,
          dataset=opt$dataset,
          nSamples=opt$n_samples,
          outputPath=opt$output_path)
```

Then, I wrote a shell script to call this function. It's an easy way to quickly invoke different simulations without having to keep chaging the function code. The command line code is shown below:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#!/usr/bin/sh
# Consensus
for j in `seq 50 10 100`
do
  # Fraction
  for k in `seq 80 5 95`
  do
    Rscript benchmark.R -e 0 -k 100 -c $j -f $k -n 10000 -s 2019 -d "barley"\
    -o "/home/mribeirodantas/dev/miic_r_package/tmp/data/output/barley_10000_samples"
  done
done
```

The output folder is actually a symbolic link to my Dropbox backup and therefore is not commited to the git repository. I decided to do it because the size of the files would make the git repository very heavy. Apart from the text files, there are plots (images).

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# In order to have the same color for the same values in the following plots,
# I had to find the global minimum and maxmium Fscore difference (Fcon - Fef)
# and I did this in the snippet below, with the csv files loaded.
color_min <- min(min(alarm$`Fscore Cons-EF`),
                 min(insurance$`Fscore Cons-EF`),
                 min(barley$`Fscore Cons-EF`))
color_max <- max(max(alarm$`Fscore Cons-EF`),
                  max(insurance$`Fscore Cons-EF`),
                  max(barley$`Fscore Cons-EF`))
# zlim was also defined like this, getting statically the max/min fscore diff.
```
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# I hard coded below the min and max values for colors
color_min = -0.26828
color_max = 0.08257096
```

## ALARM
[ALARM](http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-medium.html#alarm) is a discrete bayesian network of medium size to provide an alarm message system for patient monitoring with [37 variables](http://www.bnlearn.com/documentation/man/alarm.html) and 509 parameters (possible values).

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

      pattern = ".txt", 
      full.names = TRUE
    ),
    read_csv
  )
) -> alarm
```

The "F-score diff" mentioned in the plot below is the difference between the F-score of the inference with consensus skeleton and the F-score of the inference with edge filtering. A value bigger or equal to zero for "F-scoore diff" means that the consensus skeleton approach was better or just the same as the edge filtering one.
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

          zlim = c(-0.3,0.1), clim = c(color_min, color_max))
```

When you hover the mouse over the point in the plot below, you will be provided with three values. It's the consensus (%), the fraction for undersampling and the difference between the F-score for consensus skeleton and edge filtering.
