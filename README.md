This repository contains the source code for MIIC, a method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. This approach can be applied on a wide range of datasets and provide new biological insights on regulatory networks from single cell expression data, genomic alterations during tumor development and co-evolving residues in protein structures.

## Prerequisites
MIIC contains R and C++ sources. In order to compile MIIC you will need a c++ compiler with c++ 14.
The following R packages are dependencies : MASS, igraph, ppcor, scales, stats, Rcpp

## Installing

You may install the latest stable version that was submitted to CRAN directly from R using the package manager :
```{r}
install.packages("miic")
```
Or if you wish the latest version under development, you may clone this repository and install the package from the source using the console commmand :
```
cd miic_R_package
R CMD INSTALL .
```
