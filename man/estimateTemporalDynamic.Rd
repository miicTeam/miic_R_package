\usage{
estimateTemporalDynamic(
  input_data,
  state_order = NULL,
  movavg = NULL,
  max_nodes = 50,
  verbose_level = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_data}{[a data frame]
A data frame that contains the observational data.\cr
The expected dataframe layout is variables as columns and
time series/time steps as rows.
The time step information must be supplied in the first column and,
for each time series, be consecutive (increment of 1) and in ascending order.
Multiple trajectories can be provided, the function will consider that a
new trajectory starts each time a smaller time step than the one of the
previous row is encountered.}

\item{state_order}{[a data frame] An optional data frame providing extra
information about variables. It must have d rows where d is the number of
input variables, excluding the time step one.\cr

The following structure (named columns) is expected:\cr

"var_names" (required) contains the name of each variable as specified
by colnames(input_data), excluding the time steps column.

"var_type" (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if each
variable is to be considered as discrete (0) or continuous (1).
Discrete variables will be excluded from the temporal dynamic estimation.

"is_contextual" (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
variable is to be considered as a contextual variable (1) or not (0).
Contextual variables will be excluded from the temporal dynamic estimation.

"movavg" (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the size of
the moving average window to be applied to the variable.
Note that if "movavg" column is present in the \emph{state_order},
its values will overwrite the function parameter.}

\item{movavg}{[an integer] Optional, NULL by default.\cr
When an integer>= 2 is supplied, a moving average operation is applied
to all the non discrete and not contextual variables. If no \emph{state_order}
is provided, the discrete/continuous variables are deduced from the input
data. If you want to apply a moving average only on specific columns,
consider to use a \emph{movavg} column in the \emph{state_order} parameter.}

\item{max_nodes}{[a positive integer] The maximum number of nodes in the
final temporal causal graph. The more nodes are allowed in the temporal
causal discovery, the more precise will be the discovery but at the cost
of longer execution time. The default is set to 50 for a fast causal
discovery. On recent computers, values up to 200 or 300 nodes are usually
possible (depending on the number of trajectories and time steps in the
input data).}

\item{verbose_level}{[an integer value in the range [0,2], 1 by default]
The level of verbosity: 0 = no display, 1 = summary display, 2 = full display.}
}
\value{
A named list with two items:
\itemize{
 \item{\emph{n_layers}: the number of layers}
 \item{\emph{delta_t}: the number of time steps between the layers}
}
}
\description{
This function estimates the number of layers and number of
time steps between each layer that are needed to cover the dynamic of a
temporal dataset when reconstructing a temporal causal graph.
Using autocorrelation decay, the function computes the average relaxation
time of the variables and, in regard of a maximum number of nodes, deduces
the number of layers and number of time steps between each layer to be used.
