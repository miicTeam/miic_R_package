\title{Export temporal miic (tmiic) result to different plotting methods}
\usage{
tmiic.export(
  tmiic.res,
  display = "compact",
  show_self_loops = TRUE,
  method = "igraph"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmiic.res}{[a tmiic graph object]
The graph object returned by the \code{\link{miic}} execution in temporal mode.}

\item{display}{[a string]. Optional, default value "compact".
Possible values are \emph{"raw"}, \emph{"lagged"}, \emph{"compact"}, 
\emph{"combine"}, \emph{"unique"}, \emph{"drop"}:
\itemize{
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"raw"}, the export function will
  use the tmiic graph object as it, leading to the return of a lagged
  graph. 
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"lagged"}, the export function will
  repeat the edges over history assuming stationarity and return a lagged
  graph. 
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"compact"}, the default, nodes 
  and edges are converted into a flattened version to produce a compact 
  view of the temporal network whilst still presenting all the information
  in the export.\cr
  i.e.: X_lag1->Y_lag0, X_lag2<-Y_lag0 become respectively X->Y lag=1, 
  X<-Y lag=2.  
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"combine"}, prior to the export,
  a preprocessing will be applied to kept only one edge
  per couple of nodes. The log_confidence will be the highest one 
  of the summarized edges whilst the lag and orientation of the
  summarized edge will be an aggregation.\cr 
  i.e.: X_lag2->Y_lag0, X_lag0<-Y_lag1 will become X<->Y lag=1-2 with
  the log_confidence of X_lag2->Y_lag0 if log_confidence of 
  X_lag2->Y_lag0 > X_lag0<-Y_lag1.
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"unique"}, prior to the export,
  a preprocessing will be applied to kept only the edges having the
  highest log_confidence for a couple of nodes. 
  If several edges between the sames nodes have the same
  log_confidence, then the edge kept is the one with the minimum lag.\cr 
  i.e.: X_lag1->Y_lag0, X_lag0<-Y_lag2 with log_confidence of 
  X_lag1->Y_lag0 > X_lag0<-Y_lag2 become X->Y lag=1.
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"drop"}, prior to the export,
  a preprocessing will be applied to kept only the edges having the 
  highest log_confidence for a couple of nodes. 
  If several edges between the sames nodes have the same
  log_confidence, then the edge kept is the one with the minimum lag.\cr
  i.e. :  X_lag1->Y_lag0, X_lag0<-Y_lag2 with log_confidence of 
  X_lag1->Y_lag0 > X_lag0<-Y_lag2 become X->Y. 
  The lag information is dropped during the preprocessing and 
  will not be exported.

\item{show_self_loops}{[a boolean] Optional, TRUE by default.
When TRUE, the edges like X_lag0-X_lag1 are exported.
When FALSE, only edges having different nodes are exported.}

\item{method}{A string representing the plotting method.
Currently only "igraph" is supported.}
}
\value{
A graph object adapted to the method.
}
\description{
This function creates an object built from the result returned
by \code{\link{miic}} executed in temporal mode that is ready to be fed to 
different plotting methods.
}
\details{
