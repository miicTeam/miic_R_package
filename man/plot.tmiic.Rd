\title{Basic plot function of a temporal miic (tmiic) network inference result}
\usage{
\method{plot}{tmiic}(
  x,
  method = "igraph",
  pcor_palette = NULL,
  display = "compact",
  show_self_loops = TRUE,
  positioning_for_grid = "greedy",
  orientation_for_grid = "L",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[a tmiic object, required]

The object returned by \code{\link{miic}} in temporal mode.}

\item{method}{[a string, optional, default value "igraph"]

The plotting method, currently only "igraph" is supported.}

\item{pcor_palette}{[a color palette, optional, default value
grDevices::colorRampPalette(c("blue", "darkgrey", "red")]

Used to represent the partial correlations (the color of the edges).
The palette must be able to handle 201 shades to cover the correlation range
from -100 to +100.}

\item{display}{[a string, optional, default value "compact"]

Possible values are \emph{"raw"}, \emph{"lagged"}, \emph{"compact"},
\emph{"combine"}, \emph{"unique"}, \emph{"drop"}:
\itemize{
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"raw"}, the plot function will
  use the tmiic graph object as it, leading to the display of a lagged
  graph. Unless a specific layout is specified, nodes will be positioned
  on a grid.
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"lagged"}, the function will
  repeat the edges over history assuming stationarity and plot a lagged
  graph. Unless a specific layout is specified, nodes will be positioned
  on a grid.
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"compact"}, the default, nodes
  and edges are converted into a flattened version to produce a compact
  view of the temporal network whilst still presenting all the information
  in the plotting.\cr
  e.g. X_lag1->Y_lag0, X_lag2<-Y_lag0 become respectively X->Y lag=1,
  X<-Y lag=2.
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"combine"}, prior to the plotting,
  a pre-processing will be applied to kept only one edge
  per pair of nodes. The info_shifted will be the highest one
  of the summarized edges whilst the lag and orientation of the
  summarized edge will be an aggregation.\cr
  e.g. X_lag1->Y_lag0, X_lag2<-Y_lag0 will become X<->Y lag=1,2 with
  the info_shifted of X_lag1->Y_lag0 if info_shifted of
  X_lag1->Y_lag0 > X_lag2<-Y_lag0.
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"unique"}, prior to the plotting,
  a pre-processing will be applied to kept only the edges having the
  highest info_shifted for a pair of nodes.
  If several edges between the sames nodes have the same
  info_shifted, then the edge kept is the one with the minimum lag.\cr
  e.g. X_lag1->Y_lag0, X_lag2<-Y_lag0 with info_shifted of
  X_lag1->Y_lag0 > X_lag2<-Y_lag0 become X->Y lag=1.
\item When \emph{display} = \emph{"drop"}, the same pre-processing
  as \emph{"unique"} will be applied, then the lag information will be
  dropped and will not be displayed on the final plotting.
}}

\item{show_self_loops}{[a boolean, optional, TRUE by default]

When TRUE, the lagged edges starting and ending on the same node
are included in the igraph  object.
When FALSE, only edges having different nodes are present in the igraph
object.}

\item{positioning_for_grid}{[a string, optional, "greedy" by default]

Used only when the display is "raw" or "lagged" and no layout is supplied.
Possible values are \emph{"none"}, \emph{"alphabetical"}, \emph{"layers"},

\emph{"greedy"} and \emph{"sugiyama"}
\itemize{
\item When \emph{positioning_for_grid} = \emph{"none"}
 The nodes are positioned as they appear in the miic result
\item When \emph{positioning_for_grid} = \emph{"alphabetical"}
 The nodes are positioned alphabetically in ascending order
\item When \emph{positioning_for_grid} = \emph{"layers"}
 The nodes with the less lags will be placed on the exteriors
 while the nodes having the most lags are in the center
\item When \emph{positioning_for_grid} = \emph{"greedy"}
 A greedy algorithm will be used to placed the nodes in a way minimizing
 the crossing edges
\item When \emph{positioning_for_grid} = \emph{"sugiyama"}
 The sugiyama algorithm will be used to placed the nodes in a way
 minimizing the crossing edges
}}

\item{orientation_for_grid}{[a string, optional, "L" by default]

Used only when the display is "raw" or "lagged and no layout is supplied.
Indicates the orientation of the draw, possible values are landscape: "L"
or portrait: "P".}

This function calls \code{\link{export}} to build a plottable
object from the result returned by \code{\link{miic}} in temporal mode
and plot it.
