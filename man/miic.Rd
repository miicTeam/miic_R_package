\arguments{
\item{input_data}{[a data frame]
A n*d data frame (n rows, d variables) that contains the observational data.

In regular mode, each column corresponds to one variable and each row is a sample that gives the
values for all the observed variables. The column names correspond to the
names of the observed variables. Numeric columns will be treated as continuous
values, factors and character as categorical.

In temporal mode (when \emph{tau} >= 1), the expected dataframe layout
is variables as columns and timeseries/timesteps as rows. 
The timestep information must be supplied in the first column and, 
for each timeseries, be in ascending order.}

\item{state_order}{[a data frame]
An optional d*(2-3) data frame giving the order of the ordinal categorical variables.
It will be used during post-processing to compute the signs of the edges using partial
linear correlation. 
If specified, the data frame must have at least a "var_names" column, containing the
names of each variable as specified by colnames(input_data). A "var_type" column may
specify if each variable is to be considered as discrete (0) or continuous (1). And 
the "levels_increasing_order" column contains a single character string with all of
the unique levels of the ordinal variable in increasing order, delimited by a comma.
If the variable is categorical but not ordinal, the "levels_increasing_order" column
may instead contain NA.}

\item{true_edges}{[a data frame]
An optional E*2 data frame containing the E edges of the true graph for
computing performance after the run.}

\item{black_box}{[a data frame]
An optional E*2 data frame containing E pairs of variables that will be considered
as independent during the network reconstruction. In practice, these edges will not
be included in the skeleton initialization and cannot be part of the final result. 
Variable names must correspond to the \emph{input_data} data frame.}

\item{n_threads}{[a positive integer]
When set greater than 1, n_threads parallel threads will be used for computation. Make sure
your compiler is compatible with openmp if you wish to use multithreading.}

\item{cplx}{[a string; \emph{c("nml", "mdl")}]
In practice, the finite size of the input
dataset requires that the 2-point and 3-point information measures should be
\emph{shifted} by a \emph{complexity} term. The finite size corrections can be
based on the Minimal Description Length (MDL) criterion (set the option with "mdl").
In practice, the MDL complexity criterion tends to underestimate the relevance of
edges connecting variables with many different categories, leading to the removal of
false negative edges. To avoid such biases with finite datasets, the (universal)
Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) criterion can be used (set the option with "nml").
The default is "nml" (see Affeldt \emph{et al.}, UAI 2015).}

\item{orientation}{[a boolean value]
The miic network skeleton can be partially directed
by orienting and propagating edge directions, based on the sign and magnitude
of the conditional 3-point information of unshielded triples. The propagation
procedure relyes on probabilities; for more details, see Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017).
If set to FALSE the orientation step is not performed.}

\item{ori_proba_ratio}{[a floating point between 0 and 1] When orienting an
edge according to the probability of orientation, the threshold to accept the
orientation. For a given edge, denote by p > 0.5 the probability of
orientation, the orientation is accepted if (1 - p) / p < ori_proba_ratio.
0 means reject all orientations, 1 means accept all orientations.}

\item{propagation}{[a boolean value]
If set to FALSE, the skeleton is partially oriented with only the
v-structure orientations. Otherwise, the v-structure orientations are
propagated to downstream undirected edges in unshielded triples following
the orientation method}

\item{latent}{[a string; \emph{c("no", "yes", "orientation")}]
When set to "yes", the network reconstruction is taking into account hidden (latent)
variables. When set to "orientation", latent variables are not considered during the skeleton
reconstruction but allows bi-directed edges during the orientation. Dependence
between two observed variables due to a latent variable is indicated with a '6' in
the adjacency matrix and in the network edges.summary and by a bi-directed edge
in the (partially) oriented graph.}

\item{n_eff}{[a positive integer]
The n samples given in the \emph{input_data} data frame are expected
to be independent. In case of correlated samples such as in time series or
Monte Carlo sampling approaches, the effective number of independent samples
\emph{n_eff} can be estimated using the decay of the autocorrelation function
(Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017). This \emph{effective} number \emph{n_eff}
of \emph{independent} samples can be provided using this parameter.}

\item{n_shuffles}{[a positive integer] The number of shufflings of
the original dataset in order to evaluate the edge specific confidence
ratio of all inferred edges.}

\item{conf_threshold}{[a positive floating point] The threshold used
to filter the less probable edges following the skeleton step. See Verny
\emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017.}

\item{sample_weights}{[a numeric vector]
An optional vector containing the weight of each observation.}

\item{test_mar}{[a boolean value]
If set to TRUE, distributions with missing values will be tested with Kullback-Leibler
divergence : conditioning variables for the given link \eqn{X\rightarrow Y}\eqn{Z} will be
considered only if the divergence between the full distribution and the non-missing
distribution \eqn{KL(P(X,Y) | P(X,Y)_{!NA})} is low enough (with \eqn{P(X,Y)_{!NA}} as
the joint distribution of \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} on samples which are not missing on Z.
This is a way to ensure that data are missing at random for the considered
interaction and to avoid selection bias. Set to TRUE by default}

\item{consistent}{[a string; \emph{c("no", "orientation", "skeleton")}]
if "orientation": iterate over skeleton and orientation steps to ensure
consistency of the network;
if "skeleton": iterate over skeleton step to get a consistent skeleton, then
orient edges and discard inconsistent orientations to ensure consistency of
the network. See (Li \emph{et al.}, NeurIPS 2019) for details.}

\item{max_iteration}{[a positive integer] When the \emph{consistent} parameter
is set to "skeleton" or "orientation", the maximum number of iterations
allowed when trying to find a consistent graph. Set to 100 by default.}

\item{consensus_threshold}{[a floating point between 0.5 and 1.0]
When the \emph{consistent} parameter is set to "skeleton" or "orientation",
and when the result graph is inconsistent, or is a union of more than one
inconsistent graphs, a consensus graph will be produced based on a pool of
graphs. If the result graph is inconsistent, then the pool is made of
[max_iteration] graphs from the iterations, otherwise it is made of those
graphs in the union. In the consensus graph, the status of each edge is
determined as follows: Choose from the pool the most probable status. For
example, if the pool contains [A, B, B, B, C], then choose status B, if the
frequency of presence of B (0.6 in the example) is equal to or higher than
[consensus_threshold], then set B as the status of the edge in the consensus
graph, otherwise set undirected edge as the status. Set to 0.8 by default.}

\item{tau}{[an integer] Optional, -1 by default.\cr
Max lag used for temporal series. If \emph{tau} is supplied (integer >= 1), 
miic switches to temporal mode: it contructs a lagged graph over 
\emph{tau} / \emph{delta_tau} periods of time, and looks both for temporal 
and contemporaneous edges.\cr
Note that if \emph{delta_tau} is also supplied, \emph{tau} must be a
multiple of \emph{delta_tau}.}

\item{movavg}{[an integer] Optional, -1 by default.\cr
Used only in temporal mode. If \emph{movavg} is supplied (integer > 1), 
a moving average operation is applied to each time series.\cr}

\item{delta_tau}{[an integer] Optional, 1 by default.\cr
Used only in temporal mode. When \emph{delta_tau} is supplied (integer > 1), 
the samples will be constructed using 1 timestep every \emph{delta_tau} 
timesteps starting from the last.\cr 
i.e.: on 1000 timesteps with  \emph{tau} = 14 and \emph{delta_tau} = 7, 
the timesteps used during the samples conversion will be 1000, 993, 986 
for the first sample, the next sample will use 999, 992, 985 and so on.}

\item{verbose}{[a boolean value] If TRUE, debugging output is printed.}
}
\value{
A \emph{miic-like} object that contains:
\itemize{
 \item{all.edges.summary:}{ a data frame with information about the relationship between
 each pair of variables
 \itemize{
 \item \emph{x:} X node
 \item \emph{y:} Y node
 \item \emph{type:} contains 'N' if the edge has
 been removed or 'P' for retained edges. If a true edges file is given,
 'P' becomes 'TP' (True Positive) or 'FP' (False Positive), while
 'N' becomes 'TN' (True Negative) or 'FN' (False Negative).
 \item \emph{ai:} the contributing nodes found by the method which participate in
 the mutual information between \emph{x} and \emph{y}, and possibly separate them.
 \item \emph{info:} provides the pairwise mutual information times \emph{Nxyi} for
 the pair (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).
 \item \emph{info_cond:} provides the conditional mutual information times \emph{Nxy_ai} for
 the pair (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) when conditioned on the collected nodes \emph{ai}. It is
 equal to the \emph{info} column when \emph{ai} is an empty set.
 \item \emph{cplx:} gives the computed complexity between the (\emph{x}, \emph{y})
 variables taking into account the contributing nodes \emph{ai}. Edges that have
 have more conditional information \emph{info_cond} than \emph{cplx} are retained in the
 final graph.
 \item \emph{Nxy_ai:} gives the number of complete samples on which the information and
 the  complexity have been computed. If the input dataset has no missing value, the
 number of samples is the same for all pairs and corresponds to the total
 number of samples.
 \item \emph{log_confidence:} represents the \emph{info} - \emph{cplx} value.
 It is a way to quantify the strength of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).
 \item \emph{confidenceRatio:} this column is present if the confidence cut
 is > 0 and it represents the ratio between the probability to reject
 the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) in the dataset versus the mean probability
 to do the same in multiple (user defined) number of randomized datasets.
 \item \emph{infOrt:} the orientation of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}). It is
 the same value as in the adjacency matrix at row \emph{x} and column \emph{y} : 1 for
 unoriented, 2 for an edge from X to Y, -2 from Y to X and 6 for bidirectional.
 \item \emph{trueOrt:} the orientation of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) present
 in the true edges file if provided.
 \item \emph{isOrtOk:} information about the consistency of the inferred graph’s
 orientations with a reference graph is given (i.e. if true edges file is provided).
 Y: the orientation is consistent; N: the orientation is not consistent with
 the PAG (Partial Ancestor Graph) derived from the given true graph.
 \item \emph{sign:} the sign of the partial correlation between variables
 \emph{x} and \emph{y}, conditioned on the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.
 \item \emph{partial_correlation:} value of the partial correlation for the
 edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) conditioned on the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.
 \item \emph{isCausal:} details about the nature of the arrow tip for a directed
 edge. A directed edge in a causal graph does not necessarily imply causation but it
 does imply that the cause-effect relationship is not the other way around. An arrow-tip
 which is itself downstream of another directed edge suggests stronger causal sense and is
 marked by a 'Y', or 'N' otherwise.
 \item \emph{proba:} probabilities for the inferred orientation, derived from the three-point
 mutual information (cf Affeldt & Isambert, UAI 2015 proceedings) and noted as p(x->y);p(x<-y).
 }
 }

 \item{retained.edges.summary:} {a data frame in the format of all.edges.summary containing only the inferred edges.}

 \item{orientations.prob:} {this data frame lists the orientation probabilities of the two edges of all unshielded triples
 of the reconstructed network with the structure: node1 -- mid-node -- node2:}
 \itemize{
 \item node1: node at the end of the unshielded triplet
 \item p1: probability of the arrowhead node1 <- mid-node
 \item p2: probability of the arrowhead node1 -> mid-node
 \item mid-node: node at the center of the unshielded triplet
 \item p3: probability of the arrowhead mid-node <- node2
 \item p4: probability of the arrowhead mid-node -> node2
 \item node2: node at the end of the unshielded triplet
 \item NI3: 3 point (conditional) mutual information * N
 }


 \item {AdjMatrix:} the adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent
 the inferred graph. The entries of the matrix indicate whether pairs of
 vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. The matrix can be read as a
 (row, column) set of couples where the row represents the source node and
 the column the target node. Since miic can reconstruct mixed networks
 (including directed, undirected and bidirected edges), we will have a
 different digit for each case:
 \itemize{
 \item 1: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is undirected
 \item 2: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is directed as \emph{x} -> \emph{y}
 \item -2: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is directed as \emph{x} <- \emph{y}
 \item 6: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is bidirected
 }

\description{
MIIC (Multivariate Information based Inductive Causation) combines
constraint-based and information-theoretic approaches to disentangle direct
from indirect effects amongst correlated variables, including cause-effect
relationships and the effect of unobserved latent causes.
}
\details{
In regular mode, starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes
dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from
indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of
available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature
of causality in observational data.

In temporal mode (when \emph{tau} >= 1), miic reorganizes the dataset 
using the \emph{tau} and \emph{delta_tau} parameters to transform the timesteps 
into lagged samples. As starting point, a lagged graph is created with 
only edges having at least one node laying on the last timestep. 
Then, miic standard algorithm is applied to remove dispensable edges. 
The remaining edges are then oriented by using the temporality and the 
signature of causality in observational data.

The method relies on an information theoretic based (conditional) independence
test which is described in (Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017),
(Cabeli \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2020). It deals with both categorical
and continuous variables by performing optimal context-dependent discretization.
As such, the input data frame may contain both numerical columns which will be
treated as continuous, or character / factor columns which will be treated
as categorical. For further details on the optimal discretization method and
the conditional independence test, see the function discretizeMutual.
The user may also choose to run miic with scheme presented in
(Li \emph{et al.}, NeurIPS 2019) to improve the end result's interpretability
by ensuring consistent separating set during the skeleton iterations.
