\arguments{
\item{input_data}{[a data frame, required]

A n*d data frame (n samples, d variables) that contains the observational data.

In standard mode, each column corresponds to one variable and each row is a
sample that gives the values for all the observed variables.
The column names correspond to the names of the observed variables.
Numeric columns with at least 5 distinct values will be treated as continuous
by default whilst numeric columns with less than 5 distinct values, factors
and characters will be considered as categorical.

In temporal mode, the expected data frame layout is variables as columns
and time series/time steps as rows.
The time step information must be supplied in the first column and,
for each time series, be consecutive and in ascending order (increment of 1).
Multiple trajectories can be provided, miic will consider that a new trajectory
starts each time a smaller time step than the one of the previous row is encountered.}

\item{state_order}{[a data frame, optional, NULL by default]

A data frame providing extra information for variables. It must have d rows
where d is the number of input variables and possible columns are described
below. For optional columns, if they are not provided or contain missing
values, default values suitable for \emph{input_data} will be used.

\emph{"var_names"} (required) contains the name of each variable as specified
by colnames(input_data). In temporal mode, the time steps column should
not be mentioned in the variables list.

\emph{"var_type"} (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if each
variable is to be considered as discrete (0) or continuous (1).

\emph{"levels_increasing_order"} (optional) contains a single character string
with all of the unique levels of the ordinal variable in increasing order,
delimited by comma ','. It will be used during the post-processing to compute
the sign of an edge using Spearman's rank correlation. If a variable is
continuous or is categorical but not ordinal, this column should be NA.

\emph{"is_contextual"} (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
variable is to be considered as a contextual variable (1) or not (0).
Contextual variables cannot be the child node of any other variable (cannot
have edge with arrowhead pointing to them).

\emph{"is_consequence"} (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
variable is to be considered as a consequence variable (1) or not (0).
Edges between consequence variables are ignored, consequence variables
cannot be the parent node of any other variable and cannot be used as
contributors. Edges between a non consequence and consequence variables
are pre-oriented toward the consequence.

Several other columns are possible in temporal mode:

\emph{"n_layers"} (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the
number of layers to be considered for the variable.
Note that if a \emph{"n_layers"} column is present in the \emph{state_order},
its values will overwrite the function parameter.

\emph{"delta_t"} (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the number
of time steps between each layer for the variable.
Note that if a \emph{"delta_t"} column is present in the \emph{state_order},
its values will overwrite the function parameter.

\emph{"movavg"} (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the size of
the moving average window to be applied to the variable.
Note that if \emph{"movavg"} column is present in the \emph{state_order},
its values will overwrite the function parameter.}

\item{true_edges}{[a data frame, optional, NULL by default]

A data frame containing the edges of the true graph for
computing performance after the run.\cr
In standard mode, the expected layout is a two columns data frame, each row
representing a true edge with in each column, the variable names.
Variables names must exist in the \emph{input_data} data frame.\cr
In temporal mode, the expected layout is a three columns data frame,
with the first two columns being variable names and the third the lag.
Variables names must exist in the \emph{input_data} data frame and the lag
must be valid in the time unfolded graph. e.g. a row var1, var2, 3 is valid
with \emph{n_layers} = 4 + \emph{delta_t} = 1 or
\emph{n_layers} = 2 + \emph{delta_t} = 3
but not for \emph{n_layers} = 2 + \emph{delta_t} = 2 as there is no matching
edge in the time unfolded graph.\cr
Please note that the order is important: in standard mode, "var1 var2" will
be interpreted as var1 -> var2 and in temporal mode, "var1 var2 3" is
interpreted as var1_lag3 -> var2_lag0. Please note also that, in temporal
mode, for contextual variables that are not lagged, the expected value in the
third column for the time lag is NA.}

\item{black_box}{[a data frame, optional, NULL by default]

A data frame containing pairs of variables that will be considered
as independent during the network reconstruction. In practice, these edges
will not be included in the skeleton initialization and cannot be part of
the final result.\cr
In standard mode, the expected layout is a two columns data frame, each row
representing a forbidden edge with in each column, the variable names.
Variables names must exist in the \emph{input_data} data frame.\cr
In temporal mode, the expected layout is a three columns data frame,
with the first two columns being variable names and the third the lag.
Variables names must exist in the \emph{input_data} data frame and the lag
must be valid in the time unfolded graph. e.g. a row var1, var2, 3 is valid
with \emph{n_layers} = 4 + \emph{delta_t} = 1 or
\emph{n_layers} = 2 + \emph{delta_t} = 3
but not for \emph{n_layers} = 2 + \emph{delta_t} = 2 as there is no matching
edge in the time unfolded graph. Please note that the order is important:
var1, var2, 3 is interpreted as var1_lag3 - var2_lag0. Please note also that,
for contextual variables that are not lagged, the expected value in the
third column for the time lag is NA.}

\item{n_threads}{[a positive integer, optional, 1 by default]

When set greater than 1, n_threads parallel threads will be used for computation. Make sure
your compiler is compatible with openmp if you wish to use multithreading.}

\item{cplx}{[a string, optional, "nml" by default, possible values:
"nml", "mdl"]

In practice, the finite size of the input  dataset requires that
the 2-point and 3-point information measures should be \emph{shifted}
by a \emph{complexity} term. The finite size corrections can be based on
the Minimal Description Length (MDL) criterion.
However, the MDL complexity criterion tends to underestimate the
relevance of edges connecting variables with many different categories,
leading to the removal of false negative edges. To avoid such biases
with finite datasets, the (universal) Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML)
criterion can be used (see Affeldt \emph{et al.}, UAI 2015).}

\item{orientation}{[a boolean value, optional, TRUE by default]

The miic network skeleton can be partially directed by orienting
edge directions, based on the sign and magnitude of the conditional
3-point information of unshielded triples and, in temporal mode, using time.
If set to FALSE, the orientation step is not performed.}

\item{ori_proba_ratio}{[a floating point between 0 and 1, optional,
1 by default]

The threshold when deducing the type of an edge tip (head/tail)
from the probability of orientation.
For a given edge tip, denote by p the probability of it being a head,
the orientation is accepted if (1 - p) / p < \emph{ori_proba_ratio}.
0 means reject all orientations, 1 means accept all orientations.}

\item{ori_consensus_ratio}{[a floating point between 0 and 1, optional,
NULL by default]
Used to determine if orientations correspond to genuine causal edges
and, when consistency is activated, to deduce the orientations in
the consensus graph.\cr
Oriented edges will be marked as genuine causal when:
     (1 - p_{head} / p_{head}) < \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}
and  p_{tail} / (1 - p_{_tail}) < \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}.\cr
When consistency is activated, \emph{ori_consensus_ratio} is used as
threshold when deducing the type of an consensus edge tip (head/tail)
from the average probability of orientations over the cycle of graphs.
For a given edge tip, denote by p the average probability of it being a head,
the orientation is accepted if (1 - p) / p < \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}.\cr
If not supplied, the \emph{ori_consensus_ratio} will be initialized with
the \emph{ori_proba_ratio} value.}

\item{propagation}{[a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]

If set to FALSE, the skeleton is partially oriented with only the
v-structure orientations. Otherwise, the v-structure orientations are
propagated to downstream undirected edges in unshielded triples following
the propagation procedure, relying on probabilities (for more details,
see Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017).}

\item{latent}{[a string, optional, "orientation" by default, possible
values: "orientation", "no", "yes"]

When set to "yes", the network reconstruction is taking into account hidden
(latent) variables. When set to "orientation", latent variables are not
considered during the skeleton reconstruction but allows bi-directed edges
during the orientation.
Dependence between two observed variables due to a latent variable is
indicated with a '6' in the adjacency matrix and in the network
edges.summary and by a bi-directed edge in the (partially) oriented graph.}

\item{n_eff}{[a positive integer, optional, -1 by default]

In standard mode, the n samples given in the \emph{input_data} data frame are
expected to be independent. In case of correlated samples such as in
Monte Carlo sampling approaches, the effective number of independent samples
\emph{n_eff} can be estimated using the decay of the autocorrelation function
(Verny et al., PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017). This effective number \emph{n_eff}
of independent samples can be provided using this parameter.}

\item{n_shuffles}{[a positive integer, optional, 0 by default]

The number of shufflings of the original dataset in order to evaluate
the edge specific confidence ratio of all inferred edges.
Default is 0: no confidence cut is applied. If the number of shufflings
is set to an integer > 0, the confidence threshold must also be > 0
(e.g. \emph{n_shuffles} = 100 and \emph{conf_threshold} = 0.01).}

\item{conf_threshold}{[a positive floating point, optional, 0 by default]

The threshold used to filter the less probable edges following the skeleton
step. See Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017.
Default is 0: no confidence cut is applied. If the the confidence threshold
is set > 0, the number of shufflings must also be > 0
(e.g. \emph{n_shuffles} = 100 and \emph{conf_threshold} = 0.01).}

\item{sample_weights}{[a numeric vector, optional, NULL by default]

An vector containing the weight of each observation.  If defined, it must be
a vector of floats in the range [0,1] of size equal to the number of samples.}

\item{test_mar}{[a boolean value, optional, TRUE by default]

If set to TRUE, distributions with missing values will be tested with
Kullback-Leibler divergence: conditioning variables for the given link
\eqn{X - Y}, \eqn{Z} will be considered only if the divergence
between the full distribution and the non-missing distribution
\eqn{KL(P(X,Y) | P(X,Y)_{!NA})} is low enough (with \eqn{P(X,Y)_{!NA}} as
the joint distribution of \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} on samples which are
not missing on Z.
This is a way to ensure that data are missing at random for the considered
interaction and to avoid selection bias.}

\item{consistent}{[a string, optional, "no" by default, possible values:
"no", "orientation", "skeleton"]

If set to "orientation": iterate over skeleton and orientation steps to
ensure consistency of the network.
If set to "skeleton": iterate over skeleton step to get a consistent skeleton,
then orient edges and discard inconsistent orientations to ensure consistency
of the network (see Li \emph{et al.}, NeurIPS 2019 for details).}

\item{max_iteration}{[a positive integer, optional, 100 by default]

When the \emph{consistent} parameter is set to "skeleton" or "orientation",
the maximum number of iterations allowed when trying to find a consistent
graph.}

\item{consensus_threshold}{[a floating point between 0.5 and 1.0, optional,
0.8 by default]

When the \emph{consistent} parameter is set to "skeleton" or "orientation"
and when the result graph is inconsistent or is a union of more than
one inconsistent graphs, a consensus graph will be produced based on
a pool of graphs.
If the result graph is inconsistent, then the pool is made of
\emph{max_iteration} graphs from the iterations, otherwise it is made of
those graphs in the union.
In the consensus graph, an edge is present when the proportion of non-zero
status in the pool is above the threshold. For example, if the pool contains
[A, B, B, 0, 0], where "A", "B" are different status of the edge and "0"
indicates the absence of the edge. Then the edge is set to connected ("1")
if the proportion of non-zero status (0.6 in the example) is equal to
or higher than \emph{consensus_threshold}. (When set to connected,
the orientation of the edge will be further determined by the average
probability of orientation.)}

\item{negative_info}{[a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]

For test purpose only. If TRUE, negative shifted mutual information is
allowed during the computation when mutual information is inferior to the
complexity term.
For small dataset with complicated structures, e.g. discrete variables with
many levels, allowing for negative shifted mutual information may help
identifying weak v-structures related to those discrete variables,
as the negative three-point information in those cases will come from
the difference between two negative shifted mutual information terms
(expected to be negative due to the small sample size).
However, under this setting, a v-structure (X -> Z <- Y) in the final graph
does not necessarily imply that X is dependent on Y conditioning on Z,
As a consequence, the interpretability of the final graph
is hindered. In practice, it's advised to keep this parameter as FALSE.}

\item{mode}{[a string, optional, "S" by default, possible values are
"S": Standard (IID samples) or "TS": Temporal Stationary"]

When temporal mode is activated, the time information must be provided
in the first column of \emph{input_data}. For more details about temporal
stationary mode, see Simon \emph{et al.}, eLife reviewed preprint 2024.}

\item{n_layers}{[an integer, optional, NULL by default, must be >= 2
if supplied]

Used only in temporal mode, \emph{n_layers} defines the number of layers
that will be considered for the variables in the time unfolded graph.
The layers will be distant of \emph{delta_t} time steps.
If not supplied, the number of layers is estimated from the dynamic of the
dataset and the maximum number of nodes \emph{max_nodes} allowed in the
final lagged graph.}

\item{delta_t}{[an integer, optional, NULL by default, must be >= 1
if supplied]

Used only in temporal mode, \emph{delta_t} defines the number of time steps
between each layer.
i.e. on 1000 time steps with \emph{n_layers} = 3 and \emph{delta_t} = 7,
the time steps kept for the samples conversion will be 1, 8, 15
for the first sample, the next sample will use 2, 9, 16 and so on.
If not supplied, the number of time steps between layers is estimated
from the dynamic of the dataset and the number of layers.}

\item{movavg}{[an integer, optional, NULL by default, must be >= 2
if supplied]

Used only in temporal mode. When supplied, a moving average operation is
applied to all integer and numeric variables that are not contextual
variables.}

\item{keep_max_data}{[a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]

Used only in temporal mode. If TRUE, rows where some NAs have been
introduced during the moving averages and lagging will be kept
whilst they will be dropped if FALSE.}

\item{max_nodes}{[an integer, optional, 50 by default]

Used only in temporal mode and if the \emph{n_layers} or \emph{delta_t}
parameters are not supplied. \emph{max_nodes} is used as the maximum number
of nodes in the final graph to compute \emph{n_layers} and/or \emph{delta_t}.
The default is 50 to produce quick runs and can be increased up to 200
or 300 on recent computers to produce more precise results.}

\item{verbose}{[a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]

If TRUE, debugging output is printed.}

 parameter, 'P' becomes 'TP' (True Positive) or 'FP' (False Positive),
 while 'N' becomes 'TN' (True Negative) or 'FN' (False Negative).
 Note that, as the \emph{all.edges.summary} does not contain all the
 true negative edges, edges not present are 'TN'.}
 \item{ \emph{ai:} the contributing nodes found by the method which
 participate in the mutual information between \emph{x} and \emph{y},
 and possibly separate them.}
 \item{ \emph{raw_contributions:} describes the share of total mutual
 information between \emph{x} and \emph{y} explained by each contributor,
 measured by I'(x;y;ai|{aj}) / I'(x;y),
 where {aj} is the separating set before adding ai.}
 \item{ \emph{contributions:} describes the share of remaining mutual
 information between \emph{x} and \emph{y} explained  by each successive
 contributors, measured by I'(x;y;ai|{aj}) / I'(x;y|{aj}),
 where {aj} is the separating set before adding ai. }
 \item{ \emph{info:} provides the pairwise mutual information times
 \emph{Nxyi} for the pair (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).}
 \item{ \emph{info_cond:} provides the conditional mutual information
 times \emph{Nxy_ai} for the pair (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) when conditioned
 on the collected nodes \emph{ai}. It is
 equal to the \emph{info} column when \emph{ai} is an empty set.}
 \item{ \emph{cplx:} gives the computed complexity between the (\emph{x},
 \emph{y}) variables taking into account the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.
 Edges that have have more conditional information \emph{info_cond}
 than \emph{cplx} are retained in the final graph.}
 \item{ \emph{Nxy_ai:} gives the number of complete samples on which the
 information and the  complexity have been computed. If the input dataset
 has no missing value, the number of samples is the same for all pairs
 and corresponds to the total number of samples.}
 \item{ \emph{info_shifted:} represents the \emph{info} - \emph{cplx} value.
 It is a way to quantify the strength of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).}
 \item{ \emph{ort_inferred:} the orientation of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).
 It is the same value as in the adjacency matrix at row \emph{x} and
 column \emph{y} : 1 for un-oriented, 2 for an edge from X to Y,
 -2 from Y to X and 6 for bidirectional.}
 \item{ \emph{ort_ground_truth:} the orientation of the edge (\emph{x},
 \emph{y}) from a given reference graph when true edges are provided.}
 \item{ \emph{is_inference_correct:} indicates if the inferred graph’s
 orientations are correct by comparing with a given reference graph
 (when true edges are provided). TRUE: the orientation is correct,
 FALSE: the orientation is not in accordance with the PAG
 (Partial Ancestor Graph) derived from the given true graph.}
 \item{ \emph{is_causal:} details about the nature of the arrow tip for a
 directed edge. A directed edge in a causal graph does not necessarily imply
 causation but it does imply that the cause-effect relationship is not the
 other way around. An arrow-tip which is itself downstream of another
 directed edge suggests stronger causal sense and is marked by TRUE,
 or FALSE otherwise.\cr
 Formally, an oriented edge is marked as genuine causal when
     (1 - p_{head}) / p_{head}  < \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}
 and  p_{tail} / (1 - p_{tail}) < \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}.\cr
 Note that the genuine causality is deducible only when latent variables
  are allowed and propagation is not allowed.}
 \item{ \emph{ort_consensus:} Not computed (full of NAs) when
 consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
 if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
 When computed, indicates the consensus orientation of the edge
 determined from the consensus skeleton and the \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}
 threshold on averaged orientation probabilities.
 Possible values are 0: not connected, 1: not oriented, -2 or 2: oriented
 and 6: bi-directional (latent variable).}
 \item{ \emph{is_causal_consensus:} Not computed (full of NAs) when
 consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
 if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
 When computed, work in the same way as \emph{is_causal}
 but on the consensus graph.}
 \item{ \emph{edge_stats:} Not computed (full of NAs) when
 consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
 if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
 When computed, contains for each edge the frequencies of
 the different orientations present in the cycle of graphs.
 e.g. In a cycle of 4 graphs, if an edge is three times marked as "2"
 (oriented) and one time marked as "1" (un-oriented), edge_stats will
 contain "75\%(2);25\%(1)".}
 \item{ \emph{sign:} the sign of the partial correlation between variables
 \emph{x} and \emph{y}, conditioned on the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.}
 \item{ \emph{partial_correlation:} value of the partial correlation for the
 edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) conditioned on the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.}
 \item{ \emph{proba:} probabilities for the inferred orientation, derived
 from the three-point mutual information (cf Affeldt & Isambert, UAI 2015
 proceedings) and noted as p(x->y);p(x<-y).}
 \item{ \emph{confidence:} this column is computed when the confidence cut
 is activated. It represents the ratio between the probability to reject
 the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) in the dataset versus the mean probability
 to do the same in multiple (user defined) number of randomized datasets.}

 }

 \item{\emph{orientations.prob:} this data frame lists the orientation
 probabilities of the two edges of all unshielded triples of the
 reconstructed network with the structure: node1 -- mid-node -- node2:
 \itemize{
 \item{ \emph{node1:} node at the end of the unshielded triplet}

 \item{ \emph{p2:} probability of the arrowhead node1 -> mid-node}

 \item{ \emph{node2:} node at the end of the unshielded triplet}
 \item{ \emph{NI3:} 3 point (conditional) mutual information * N}
 \item{ \emph{Conflict:} indicates if there a conflict between the
 computed probabilities and the NI3 value}
 }
 }

 \item {\emph{adj_matrix:} the adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to
 represent the inferred graph. The entries of the matrix indicate whether
 pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. The matrix can be read
 as a (row, column) set of couples where the row represents the source node
 and the column the target node. Since miic can reconstruct mixed networks
 (including directed, undirected and bidirected edges), we will have a
 different digit for each case:
 \itemize{
 \item{ 1: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is un-directed}
 \item{ 2: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is directed as \emph{x} -> \emph{y} }
 \item{ -2: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is directed as \emph{x} <- \emph{y} }
 \item{ 6: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is bi-directed}
 }
 }

 \item {\emph{proba_adj_matrix:} the probability adjacency matrix is
 a square matrix used to represent the orientation probabilities associated
 to the edges tips. The value at ("row", "column") is the probability,
 for the edge between "row" and "column" nodes, of the edge tip on the "row"
 side. A probability less than 0.5 is an indication of a possible tail
 (cause) and a probability greater than 0.5 a possible head (effect). }

 which is part of the resulting cycle of graphs. Each item is a
 square matrix with the same format as \emph{proba_adj_matrix}. }

 \item {\emph{proba_adj_average:} present only when consistency is activated.

 of the consensus graph.
 The value at ("row", "column") is the average probability, for the edge
 between "row" and "column" nodes, of the edge tip on the "row" side.
 A probability less than 0.5 is an indication of a possible tail
 (cause) and a probability greater than 0.5 a possible head (effect). }

 interrupted, FALSE otherwise. }

 reconstruction. The parameters not supplied are initialized to their default
 values. Otherwise, the parameters are checked and corrected if necessary. }

\description{
MIIC (Multivariate Information based Inductive Causation) combines
constraint-based and information-theoretic approaches to disentangle direct
from indirect effects amongst correlated variables, including cause-effect
relationships and the effect of unobserved latent causes.
}
\details{
In standard mode, starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes
dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from
indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of
available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature
of causality in observational data.

In temporal mode, miic reorganizes the dataset using the \emph{n_layers} and
\emph{delta_t} parameters to transform the time steps into lagged samples.
As starting point, a lagged graph is created with only edges having at
least one node laying on the last time step.
Then, miic standard algorithm is applied to remove dispensable edges.
The remaining edges are then oriented by using the temporality and the
signature of causality in observational data. The use of temporal mode
is exposed in Simon \emph{et al.}, eLife reviewed preprint 2024.

The method relies on an information theoretic based (conditional) independence
test which is described in (Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017),
(Cabeli \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2020). It deals with both categorical
and continuous variables by performing optimal context-dependent discretization.
As such, the input data frame may contain both numerical columns which will be
treated as continuous, or character / factor columns which will be treated
as categorical. For further details on the optimal discretization method and
the conditional independence test, see the function discretizeMutual.
The user may also choose to run miic with scheme presented in
(Li \emph{et al.}, NeurIPS 2019) to improve the end result's interpretability
by ensuring consistent separating set during the skeleton iterations.
