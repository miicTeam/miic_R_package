#' MIIC, causal network learning algorithm including latent variables
#'
#' @description MIIC (Multivariate Information based Inductive Causation) combines
#' constraint-based and information-theoretic approaches to disentangle direct
#' from indirect effects amongst correlated variables, including cause-effect
#' relationships and the effect of unobserved latent causes.
#'
#' @details In regular mode, starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes
#' dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from
#' indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of
#' available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature
#' of causality in observational data.
#'
#' In temporal mode, miic reorganizes the dataset
#' using the \emph{n_layers} and \emph{delta_t} parameters to transform the timesteps
#' into lagged samples. As starting point, a lagged graph is created with
#' only edges having at least one node laying on the last timestep.
#' Then, miic standard algorithm is applied to remove dispensable edges.
#' The remaining edges are then oriented by using the temporality and the
#' signature of causality in observational data.
#'
#' The method relies on an information theoretic based (conditional) independence
#' test which is described in (Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017),
#' (Cabeli \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2020). It deals with both categorical
#' and continuous variables by performing optimal context-dependent discretization.
#' As such, the input data frame may contain both numerical columns which will be
#' treated as continuous, or character / factor columns which will be treated
#' as categorical. For further details on the optimal discretization method and
#' the conditional independence test, see the function discretizeMutual.
#' The user may also choose to run miic with scheme presented in
#' (Li \emph{et al.}, NeurIPS 2019) to improve the end result's interpretability
#' by ensuring consistent separating set during the skeleton iterations.
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{discretizeMutual}} for optimal discretization and
#' (conditional) independence test.

#'
#' @param input_data [a data frame]
#' A n*d data frame (n samples, d variables) that contains the observational data.
#'
#' In regular mode, each column corresponds to one variable and each row is a sample that gives the
#' values for all the observed variables. The column names correspond to the
#' names of the observed variables. Numeric columns will be treated as continuous
#' values, factors and character as categorical.
#'
#' In temporal mode, the expected dataframe layout is variables as columns
#' and timeseries/timesteps as rows.
#' The timestep information must be supplied in the first column and,
#' for each timeseries, be consecutive (increment of 1) and in ascending order.
#' Multiple trajectories can be provided, miic will consider that a new trajectory
#' starts each time a smaller timestep than the one of the previous row is encountered.
#'
#' @param black_box [a data frame]
#' An optional E*2 data frame containing E pairs of variables that will be considered
#' as independent during the network reconstruction. In practice, these edges will not
#' be included in the skeleton initialization and cannot be part of the final result.
#' Variable names must correspond to the \emph{input_data} data frame.
#'
#' @param n_eff [a positive integer]
#' In regular mode, the n samples given in the \emph{input_data} data frame are
#' expected to be independent. In case of correlated samples such as in
#' Monte Carlo sampling approaches, the effective number of independent samples
#' \emph{n_eff} can be estimated using the decay of the autocorrelation function
#' (Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017). This \emph{effective} number \emph{n_eff}
#' of \emph{independent} samples can be provided using this parameter.
#'
#' @param cplx [a string; \emph{c("nml", "mdl")}]
#' In practice, the finite size of the input
#' dataset requires that the 2-point and 3-point information measures should be
#' \emph{shifted} by a \emph{complexity} term. The finite size corrections can be
#' based on the Minimal Description Length (MDL) criterion (set the option with "mdl").
#' In practice, the MDL complexity criterion tends to underestimate the relevance of
#' edges connecting variables with many different categories, leading to the removal of
#' false negative edges. To avoid such biases with finite datasets, the (universal)
#' Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) criterion can be used (set the option with "nml").
#' The default is "nml" (see Affeldt \emph{et al.}, UAI 2015).
#'
#' @param latent [a string; \emph{c("orientation", "no", "yes")}]
#' When set to "yes", the network reconstruction is taking into account hidden (latent)
#' variables. When set to "orientation", latent variables are not considered during the skeleton
#' reconstruction but allows bi-directed edges during the orientation. Dependence
#' between two observed variables due to a latent variable is indicated with a '6' in
#' the adjacency matrix and in the network edges.summary and by a bi-directed edge
#' in the (partially) oriented graph.
#'
#' @param orientation [a boolean value]
#' The miic network skeleton can be partially directed
#' by orienting and propagating edge directions, based on the sign and magnitude
#' of the conditional 3-point information of unshielded triples. The propagation
#' procedure relyes on probabilities; for more details, see Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017).
#' If set to FALSE the orientation step is not performed.
#'
#' @param ori_proba_ratio [a floating point between 0 and 1] The threshold when
#' deducing the type of an edge tip (head/tail) from the probability of
#' orientation. For a given edge tip, denote by p the probability of it being a
#' head, the orientation is accepted if (1 - p) / p < ori_proba_ratio. 0 means
#' reject all orientations, 1 means accept all orientations.
#'
#' @param ori_consensus_ratio [a floating point between 0 and 1] The threshold
#' when deducing the type of an consensus edge tip (head/tail) from the average
#' probability of orientation. For a given edge tip, denote by p the probability
#' of it being a head, the orientation is accepted if (1 - p) / p <
#' ori_consensus_ratio. 0 means reject all orientations, 1 means accept all
#' orientations.
#'
#' @param propagation [a boolean value]
#' If set to FALSE, the skeleton is partially oriented with only the
#' v-structure orientations. Otherwise, the v-structure orientations are
#' propagated to downstream undirected edges in unshielded triples following
#' the orientation method
#'
#' @param state_order [a data frame] An optional data frame providing extra
#' information for variables. It must have d rows where d is the number of input
#' variables, and the following structure (named columns):
#'
#' "var_names" (required) contains the name of each variable as specified
#' by colnames(input_data).
#'
#' "var_type" (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if each
#' variable is to be considered as discrete (0) or continuous (1).
#'
#' "levels_increasing_order" (optional) contains a single character string
#' with all of the unique levels of the ordinal variable in increasing order,
#' delimited by comma ','. It will be used during the post-processing to compute
#' the sign of an edge using Spearman's rank correlation. If a variable is
#' continuous or is categorical but not ordinal, this column should be NA.
#'
#' "is_contextual" (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
#' variable is to be considered as a contextual variable (1) or not (0).
#' Contextual variables cannot be the child node of any other variable (cannot
#' have edge with arrowhead pointing to them).
#'
#' "is_consequence" (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
#' variable is to be considered as a consequence variable (1) or not (0).
#' Consequence variables cannot be the parent node of any other variable
#' and cannot be used as contributors.
#'
#' "n_layers" (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the number of
#' layers to be considered for the variable.\cr
#' Note that if a "n_layers" column is present in the \emph{state_order},
#' its values will overwrite the function parameter.
#'
#' "delta_t" (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the number
#' of timesteps between each layer for the variable.
#' Note that if a "delta_t" column is present in the \emph{state_order},
#' its values will overwrite the function parameter.
#'
#' "movavg" (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the size of
#' the moving average window to be applied to the variable.
#' Note that if "movavg" column is present in the \emph{state_order},
#' its values will overwrite the function parameter.
#'
#' @param true_edges [a data frame]
#' An optional E*2 data frame containing the E edges of the true graph for
#' computing performance after the run.
#'
#' @param n_shuffles [a positive integer] The number of shufflings of
#' the original dataset in order to evaluate the edge specific confidence
#' ratio of all inferred edges. Default is 0: no confidence cut. If the
#' number of shufflings is set to an integer > 0, the confidence threshold
#' must also be > 0 (i.e:  n_shuffles=100 and conf_threshold=0.01).
#'
#' @param conf_threshold [a positive floating point] The threshold used
#' to filter the less probable edges following the skeleton step. See Verny
#' \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017. Default is 0: no confidence cut. If the
#' the confidence threshold is set > 0, the number of shufflings must also
#' be defined > 0 (i.e:  n_shuffles=100 and conf_threshold=0.01).
#'
#' @param sample_weights [a numeric vector]
#' An optional vector containing the weight of each observation. NULL by default.
#' If defined, it must be a vector of floats in the range [0,1] of size equal
#' to the number of samples.
#'
#' @param test_mar [a boolean value]
#' If set to TRUE, distributions with missing values will be tested with Kullback-Leibler
#' divergence : conditioning variables for the given link \eqn{X\rightarrow Y}\eqn{Z} will be
#' considered only if the divergence between the full distribution and the non-missing
#' distribution \eqn{KL(P(X,Y) | P(X,Y)_{!NA})} is low enough (with \eqn{P(X,Y)_{!NA}} as
#' the joint distribution of \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} on samples which are not missing on Z.
#' This is a way to ensure that data are missing at random for the considered
#' interaction and to avoid selection bias. Set to TRUE by default
#'
#' @param consistent [a string; \emph{c("no", "orientation", "skeleton")}]
#' if "orientation": iterate over skeleton and orientation steps to ensure
#' consistency of the network;
#' if "skeleton": iterate over skeleton step to get a consistent skeleton, then
#' orient edges and discard inconsistent orientations to ensure consistency of
#' the network. See (Li \emph{et al.}, NeurIPS 2019) for details.
#'
#' @param max_iteration [a positive integer] When the \emph{consistent} parameter
#' is set to "skeleton" or "orientation", the maximum number of iterations
#' allowed when trying to find a consistent graph. Set to 100 by default.
#'
#' @param consensus_threshold [a floating point between 0.5 and 1.0] When the
#' \emph{consistent} parameter is set to "skeleton" or "orientation", and when
#' the result graph is inconsistent, or is a union of more than one inconsistent
#' graphs, a consensus graph will be produced based on a pool of graphs. If the
#' result graph is inconsistent, then the pool is made of [max_iteration] graphs
#' from the iterations, otherwise it is made of those graphs in the union. In
#' the consensus graph, an edge is present when the proportion of non-zero
#' status in the pool is above the threshold. For example, if the pool contains
#' [A, B, B, 0, 0], where "A", "B" are different status of the edge and "0"
#' indicates the absence of the edge. Then the edge is set to connected ("1") if
#' the proportion of non-zero status (0.6 in the example) is equal to or higher
#' than [consensus_threshold]. (When set to connected, the orientation of the
#' edge will be further determined by the average probability of orientation.)
#' Set to 0.8 by default.
#'
#' @param mode [a string] Optional, "S" by default, possible values are
#' "S": Standard (IID samples) or "TS": Temporal Stationary. When temporal mode
#' is activated, the time information must be provided in the first column of
#' the dataset.
#'
#' @param n_layers [an integer] Optional, NULL by default, must >= 2 if supplied.\cr
#' Used only in temporal mode, \emph{n_layers} defines the number of layers
#' that will be considered for the variables. The layers will be distant of
#' \emph{delta_t} timesteps.\cr
#' If not supplied, the number of layers is estimated from the dynamic of the
#' dataset and the maximum number of nodes \emph{max_nodes} allowed in the
#' final lagged graph.
#'
#' @param delta_t [an integer] Optional, NULL by default, must >= 1 if supplied.\cr
#' Used only in temporal mode. \emph{delta_t} defines the number of timesteps
#' between each layer.\cr
#' i.e.: on 1000 timesteps with  \emph{n_layers} = 3 and \emph{delta_t} = 7,
#' the timesteps kept for the samples conversion will be 1, 8, 15
#' for the first sample, the next sample will use 2, 9, 16 and so on.\cr
#' If not supplied, the number of timesteps between layers is estimated
#' from the dynamic of the dataset and the number of layers.
#'
#' @param movavg [an integer] Optional, NULL by default, must be >= 2 if supplied\cr
#' Used only in temporal mode.\cr
#' When an integer is supplied (integer >= 2), a moving average
#' operation is applied to all integer and numeric variables that are not
#' contextual variables.
#'
#' @param keep_max_data [a boolean] Optional, FALSE by default.\cr
#' Used only in temporal mode. If TRUE, rows where some NAs have been
#' introduced during the moving averages and lagging will be kept
#' whilst they will be dropped if FALSE.
#'
#' @param max_nodes [an integer] Optional, 50 by default.\cr
#' Used only in temporal mode and if the \emph{n_layers} or \emph{delta_t}
#' parameters are not supplied. \emph{max_nodes} is used as the maximum number
#' of nodes in the final graph to compute \emph{n_layers} and/or \emph{delta_t}.
#' The default is 50 to produce quick runs and can be increased up to 200
#' or 300 on recent computers to produce more precise results.
#'
#' @param verbose [a boolean value] If TRUE, debugging output is printed.
#'
#' @param n_threads [a positive integer]
#' When set greater than 1, n_threads parallel threads will be used for computation. Make sure
#' your compiler is compatible with openmp if you wish to use multithreading.
#'
#' @param negative_info [a boolean value] For test purpose only. FALSE by
#' default. If TRUE, negative shifted mutual information is allowed during the
#' computation when mutual information is inferior to the complexity term. For
#' small dateset with complicated structures, e.g., discrete variables with many
#' levels, allowing for negative shifted mutual information may help identifying
#' weak v-structures related to those discrete variables, as the negative
#' three-point information in those cases will come from the difference between
#' two negative shifted mutual information terms (expected to be negative due to
#' the small sample size). However, under this setting, a v-structure (X -> Z <-
#' Y) in the final graph does not necessarily imply that X is dependent on Y
#' conditioning on Z, As a consequence, the interpretability of the final graph
#' is hindered. In practice, it's advised to keep this parameter as FALSE.
#'
#' @return A \emph{miic-like} object that contains:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{all.edges.summary:}{ a data frame with information about the relationship between
#'  each pair of variables
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item \emph{x:} X node
#'  \item \emph{y:} Y node
#'  \item \emph{type:} contains 'N' if the edge has
#'  been removed or 'P' for retained edges. If a true edges file is given,
#'  'P' becomes 'TP' (True Positive) or 'FP' (False Positive), while
#'  'N' becomes 'TN' (True Negative) or 'FN' (False Negative).
#'  \item \emph{ai:} the contributing nodes found by the method which participate in
#'  the mutual information between \emph{x} and \emph{y}, and possibly separate them.
#'  \item \emph{info:} provides the pairwise mutual information times \emph{Nxyi} for
#'  the pair (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).
#'  \item \emph{info_cond:} provides the conditional mutual information times \emph{Nxy_ai} for
#'  the pair (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) when conditioned on the collected nodes \emph{ai}. It is
#'  equal to the \emph{info} column when \emph{ai} is an empty set.
#'  \item \emph{cplx:} gives the computed complexity between the (\emph{x}, \emph{y})
#'  variables taking into account the contributing nodes \emph{ai}. Edges that have
#'  have more conditional information \emph{info_cond} than \emph{cplx} are retained in the
#'  final graph.
#'  \item \emph{Nxy_ai:} gives the number of complete samples on which the information and
#'  the  complexity have been computed. If the input dataset has no missing value, the
#'  number of samples is the same for all pairs and corresponds to the total
#'  number of samples.
#'  \item \emph{info_shifted:} represents the \emph{info} - \emph{cplx} value.
#'  It is a way to quantify the strength of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).
#'  \item \emph{confidenceRatio:} this column is present if the confidence cut
#'  is > 0 and it represents the ratio between the probability to reject
#'  the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) in the dataset versus the mean probability
#'  to do the same in multiple (user defined) number of randomized datasets.
#'  \item \emph{infOrt:} the orientation of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}). It is
#'  the same value as in the adjacency matrix at row \emph{x} and column \emph{y} : 1 for
#'  unoriented, 2 for an edge from X to Y, -2 from Y to X and 6 for bidirectional.
#'  \item \emph{trueOrt:} the orientation of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) present
#'  in the true edges file if provided.
#'  \item \emph{isOrtOk:} information about the consistency of the inferred graph’s
#'  orientations with a reference graph is given (i.e. if true edges file is provided).
#'  Y: the orientation is consistent; N: the orientation is not consistent with
#'  the PAG (Partial Ancestor Graph) derived from the given true graph.
#'  \item \emph{sign:} the sign of the partial correlation between variables
#'  \emph{x} and \emph{y}, conditioned on the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.
#'  \item \emph{partial_correlation:} value of the partial correlation for the
#'  edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) conditioned on the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.
#'  \item \emph{isCausal:} details about the nature of the arrow tip for a directed
#'  edge. A directed edge in a causal graph does not necessarily imply causation but it
#'  does imply that the cause-effect relationship is not the other way around. An arrow-tip
#'  which is itself downstream of another directed edge suggests stronger causal sense and is
#'  marked by a 'Y', or 'N' otherwise.
#'  \item \emph{proba:} probabilities for the inferred orientation, derived from the three-point
#'  mutual information (cf Affeldt & Isambert, UAI 2015 proceedings) and noted as p(x->y);p(x<-y).

#'  }
#'
#'  \item{orientations.prob:} {this data frame lists the orientation probabilities of the two edges of all unshielded triples
#'  of the reconstructed network with the structure: node1 -- mid-node -- node2:}
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item node1: node at the end of the unshielded triplet
#'  \item p1: probability of the arrowhead node1 <- mid-node
#'  \item p2: probability of the arrowhead node1 -> mid-node
#'  \item mid-node: node at the center of the unshielded triplet
#'  \item p3: probability of the arrowhead mid-node <- node2

#'  \item NI3: 3 point (conditional) mutual information * N
#'  }
#'
#'  \item {adj_matrix:} the adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent
#'  the inferred graph. The entries of the matrix indicate whether pairs of
#'  vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. The matrix can be read as a
#'  (row, column) set of couples where the row represents the source node and
#'  the column the target node. Since miic can reconstruct mixed networks
#'  (including directed, undirected and bidirected edges), we will have a
#'  different digit for each case:
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item 1: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is undirected
#'  \item 2: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is directed as \emph{x} -> \emph{y}
#'  \item -2: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is directed as \emph{x} <- \emph{y}
#'  \item 6: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is bidirected
#'  }
#'
#'  \item {params:} the list of parameters used for the network reconstruction.
#'  The parameters not supplied are initialized to their default values.
#'  Otherwise, the parameters are checked and corrected if necessary.

#'  \item {tmiic:} present only in temporal mode.
#'  Named list containing the full list of edges completed by stationarity,
