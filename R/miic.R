#' MIIC, causal network learning algorithm including latent variables
#'
#' @description MIIC (Multivariate Information based Inductive Causation) combines
#' constraint-based and information-theoretic approaches to disentangle direct
#' from indirect effects amongst correlated variables, including cause-effect
#' relationships and the effect of unobserved latent causes.
#'
#' @details In standard mode, starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes
#' dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from
#' indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of
#' available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature
#' of causality in observational data.
#'
#' In temporal mode, miic reorganizes the dataset using the \emph{n_layers} and
#' \emph{delta_t} parameters to transform the time steps into lagged samples.
#' As starting point, a lagged graph is created with only edges having at
#' least one node laying on the last time step.
#' Then, miic standard algorithm is applied to remove dispensable edges.
#' The remaining edges are then oriented by using the temporality and the
#' signature of causality in observational data. The use of temporal mode
#' is exposed in Simon \emph{et al.}, eLife reviewed preprint 2024.
#'
#' The method relies on an information theoretic based (conditional) independence
#' test which is described in (Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017),
#' (Cabeli \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2020). It deals with both categorical
#' and continuous variables by performing optimal context-dependent discretization.
#' As such, the input data frame may contain both numerical columns which will be
#' treated as continuous, or character / factor columns which will be treated
#' as categorical. For further details on the optimal discretization method and
#' the conditional independence test, see the function discretizeMutual.
#' The user may also choose to run miic with scheme presented in
#' (Li \emph{et al.}, NeurIPS 2019) to improve the end result's interpretability
#' by ensuring consistent separating set during the skeleton iterations.

#'
#' @param input_data [a data frame, required]
#'
#' A n*d data frame (n samples, d variables) that contains the observational data.
#'
#' In standard mode, each column corresponds to one variable and each row is a
#' sample that gives the values for all the observed variables.
#' The column names correspond to the names of the observed variables.
#' Numeric columns with at least 5 distinct values will be treated as continuous
#' by default whilst numeric columns with less than 5 distinct values, factors
#' and characters will be considered as categorical.
#'
#' In temporal mode, the expected data frame layout is variables as columns
#' and time series/time steps as rows.
#' The time step information must be supplied in the first column and,
#' for each time series, be consecutive and in ascending order (increment of 1).
#' Multiple trajectories can be provided, miic will consider that a new trajectory
#' starts each time a smaller time step than the one of the previous row is encountered.
#'
#' @param state_order [a data frame, optional, NULL by default]
#'
#' A data frame providing extra information for variables. It must have d rows
#' where d is the number of input variables and possible columns are described
#' below. For optional columns, if they are not provided or contain missing
#' values, default values suitable for \emph{input_data} will be used.
#'
#' \emph{"var_names"} (required) contains the name of each variable as specified
#' by colnames(input_data). In temporal mode, the time steps column should
#' not be mentioned in the variables list.
#'
#' \emph{"var_type"} (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if each
#' variable is to be considered as discrete (0) or continuous (1).
#'
#' \emph{"levels_increasing_order"} (optional) contains a single character string
#' with all of the unique levels of the ordinal variable in increasing order,
#' delimited by comma ','. It will be used during the post-processing to compute
#' the sign of an edge using Spearman's rank correlation. If a variable is
#' continuous or is categorical but not ordinal, this column should be NA.
#'
#' \emph{"is_contextual"} (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
#' variable is to be considered as a contextual variable (1) or not (0).
#' Contextual variables cannot be the child node of any other variable (cannot
#' have edge with arrowhead pointing to them).
#'
#' \emph{"is_consequence"} (optional) contains a binary value that specifies if a
#' variable is to be considered as a consequence variable (1) or not (0).
#' Edges between consequence variables are ignored, consequence variables
#' cannot be the parent node of any other variable and cannot be used as
#' contributors. Edges between a non consequence and consequence variables
#' are pre-oriented toward the consequence.
#'
#' Several other columns are possible in temporal mode:
#'
#' \emph{"n_layers"} (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the
#' number of layers to be considered for the variable.
#' Note that if a \emph{"n_layers"} column is present in the \emph{state_order},
#' its values will overwrite the function parameter.
#'
#' \emph{"delta_t"} (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the number
#' of time steps between each layer for the variable.
#' Note that if a \emph{"delta_t"} column is present in the \emph{state_order},
#' its values will overwrite the function parameter.
#'
#' \emph{"movavg"} (optional) contains an integer value that specifies the size of
#' the moving average window to be applied to the variable.
#' Note that if \emph{"movavg"} column is present in the \emph{state_order},
#' its values will overwrite the function parameter.
#'
#' @param true_edges [a data frame, optional, NULL by default]
#'
#' A data frame containing the edges of the true graph for
#' computing performance after the run.\cr
#' In standard mode, the expected layout is a two columns data frame, each row
#' representing a true edge with in each column, the variable names.
#' Variables names must exist in the \emph{input_data} data frame.\cr
#' In temporal mode, the expected layout is a three columns data frame,
#' with the first two columns being variable names and the third the lag.
#' Variables names must exist in the \emph{input_data} data frame and the lag
#' must be valid in the time unfolded graph. e.g. a row var1, var2, 3 is valid
#' with \emph{n_layers} = 4 + \emph{delta_t} = 1 or
#' \emph{n_layers} = 2 + \emph{delta_t} = 3
#' but not for \emph{n_layers} = 2 + \emph{delta_t} = 2 as there is no matching
#' edge in the time unfolded graph.\cr
#' Please note that the order is important: in standard mode, "var1 var2" will
#' be interpreted as var1 -> var2 and in temporal mode, "var1 var2 3" is
#' interpreted as var1_lag3 -> var2_lag0. Please note also that, in temporal
#' mode, for contextual variables that are not lagged, the expected value in the
#' third column for the time lag is NA.
#'
#' @param black_box [a data frame, optional, NULL by default]
#'
#' A data frame containing pairs of variables that will be considered
#' as independent during the network reconstruction. In practice, these edges
#' will not be included in the skeleton initialization and cannot be part of
#' the final result.\cr
#' In standard mode, the expected layout is a two columns data frame, each row
#' representing a forbidden edge with in each column, the variable names.
#' Variables names must exist in the \emph{input_data} data frame.\cr
#' In temporal mode, the expected layout is a three columns data frame,
#' with the first two columns being variable names and the third the lag.
#' Variables names must exist in the \emph{input_data} data frame and the lag
#' must be valid in the time unfolded graph. e.g. a row var1, var2, 3 is valid
#' with \emph{n_layers} = 4 + \emph{delta_t} = 1 or
#' \emph{n_layers} = 2 + \emph{delta_t} = 3
#' but not for \emph{n_layers} = 2 + \emph{delta_t} = 2 as there is no matching
#' edge in the time unfolded graph. Please note that the order is important:
#' var1, var2, 3 is interpreted as var1_lag3 - var2_lag0. Please note also that,
#' for contextual variables that are not lagged, the expected value in the
#' third column for the time lag is NA.
#'
#' @param n_threads [a positive integer, optional, 1 by default]
#'
#' When set greater than 1, n_threads parallel threads will be used for computation. Make sure
#' your compiler is compatible with openmp if you wish to use multithreading.
#'
#' @param cplx [a string, optional, "nml" by default, possible values:
#' "nml", "mdl"]
#'
#' In practice, the finite size of the input  dataset requires that
#' the 2-point and 3-point information measures should be \emph{shifted}
#' by a \emph{complexity} term. The finite size corrections can be based on
#' the Minimal Description Length (MDL) criterion.
#' However, the MDL complexity criterion tends to underestimate the
#' relevance of edges connecting variables with many different categories,
#' leading to the removal of false negative edges. To avoid such biases
#' with finite datasets, the (universal) Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML)
#' criterion can be used (see Affeldt \emph{et al.}, UAI 2015).
#'
#' @param orientation [a boolean value, optional, TRUE by default]
#'
#' The miic network skeleton can be partially directed by orienting
#' edge directions, based on the sign and magnitude of the conditional
#' 3-point information of unshielded triples and, in temporal mode, using time.
#' If set to FALSE, the orientation step is not performed.
#'
#' @param ori_proba_ratio [a floating point between 0 and 1, optional,
#' 1 by default]
#'
#' The threshold when deducing the type of an edge tip (head/tail)
#' from the probability of orientation.
#' For a given edge tip, denote by p the probability of it being a head,
#' the orientation is accepted if (1 - p) / p < \emph{ori_proba_ratio}.
#' 0 means reject all orientations, 1 means accept all orientations.
#'
#' @param ori_consensus_ratio [a floating point between 0 and 1, optional,
#' NULL by default]
#' Used to determine if orientations correspond to genuine causal edges
#' and, when consistency is activated, to deduce the orientations in
#' the consensus graph.\cr
#' Oriented edges will be marked as genuine causal when:
#'      \eqn{ (1 - p_{head}) / p_{head} < } \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}
#' and  \eqn{ p_{tail} / (1 - p_{tail}) < } \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}.\cr
#' When consistency is activated, \emph{ori_consensus_ratio} is used as
#' threshold when deducing the type of an consensus edge tip (head/tail)
#' from the average probability of orientations over the cycle of graphs.
#' For a given edge tip, denote by p the average probability of it being a head,
#' the orientation is accepted if (1 - p) / p < \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}.\cr
#' If not supplied, the \emph{ori_consensus_ratio} will be initialized with
#' the \emph{ori_proba_ratio} value.
#'
#' @param propagation [a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]
#'
#' If set to FALSE, the skeleton is partially oriented with only the
#' v-structure orientations. Otherwise, the v-structure orientations are
#' propagated to downstream undirected edges in unshielded triples following
#' the propagation procedure, relying on probabilities (for more details,
#' see Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017).
#'
#' @param latent [a string, optional, "orientation" by default, possible
#' values: "orientation", "no", "yes"]
#'
#' When set to "yes", the network reconstruction is taking into account hidden
#' (latent) variables. When set to "orientation", latent variables are not
#' considered during the skeleton reconstruction but allows bi-directed edges
#' during the orientation.
#' Dependence between two observed variables due to a latent variable is
#' indicated with a '6' in the adjacency matrix and in the network
#' edges.summary and by a bi-directed edge in the (partially) oriented graph.
#'
#' @param n_eff [a positive integer, optional, -1 by default]
#'
#' In standard mode, the n samples given in the \emph{input_data} data frame are
#' expected to be independent. In case of correlated samples such as in
#' Monte Carlo sampling approaches, the effective number of independent samples
#' \emph{n_eff} can be estimated using the decay of the autocorrelation function
#' (Verny et al., PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017). This effective number \emph{n_eff}
#' of independent samples can be provided using this parameter.
#'
#' @param n_shuffles [a positive integer, optional, 0 by default]
#'
#' The number of shufflings of the original dataset in order to evaluate
#' the edge specific confidence ratio of all retained edges.
#' Default is 0: no confidence cut is applied. If the number of shufflings
#' is set to an integer > 0, the confidence threshold must also be > 0
#' (e.g. \emph{n_shuffles} = 100 and \emph{conf_threshold} = 0.01).
#'
#' @param conf_threshold [a positive floating point, optional, 0 by default]
#'
#' The threshold used to filter the less probable edges following the skeleton
#' step. See Verny \emph{et al.}, PLoS Comp. Bio. 2017.
#' Default is 0: no confidence cut is applied. If the the confidence threshold
#' is set > 0, the number of shufflings must also be > 0
#' (e.g. \emph{n_shuffles} = 100 and \emph{conf_threshold} = 0.01).
#'
#' @param sample_weights [a numeric vector, optional, NULL by default]
#'
#' An vector containing the weight of each observation.  If defined, it must be
#' a vector of floats in the range [0,1] of size equal to the number of samples.
#'
#' @param test_mar [a boolean value, optional, TRUE by default]
#'
#' If set to TRUE, distributions with missing values will be tested with
#' Kullback-Leibler divergence: conditioning variables for the given link
#' \eqn{X - Y}, \eqn{Z} will be considered only if the divergence
#' between the full distribution and the non-missing distribution
#' \eqn{KL(P(X,Y) | P(X,Y)_{!NA})} is low enough (with \eqn{P(X,Y)_{!NA}} as
#' the joint distribution of \eqn{X} and \eqn{Y} on samples which are
#' not missing on Z.
#' This is a way to ensure that data are missing at random for the considered
#' interaction and to avoid selection bias.
#'
#' @param consistent [a string, optional, "no" by default, possible values:
#' "no", "orientation", "skeleton"]
#'
#' If set to "orientation": iterate over skeleton and orientation steps to
#' ensure consistency of the network.
#' If set to "skeleton": iterate over skeleton step to get a consistent skeleton,
#' then orient edges and discard inconsistent orientations to ensure consistency
#' of the network (see Li \emph{et al.}, NeurIPS 2019 for details).
#'
#' @param max_iteration [a positive integer, optional, 100 by default]
#'
#' When the \emph{consistent} parameter is set to "skeleton" or "orientation",
#' the maximum number of iterations allowed when trying to find a consistent
#' graph.
#'
#' @param consensus_threshold [a floating point between 0.5 and 1.0, optional,
#' 0.8 by default]
#'
#' When the \emph{consistent} parameter is set to "skeleton" or "orientation"
#' and when the result graph is inconsistent or is a union of more than
#' one inconsistent graphs, a consensus graph will be produced based on
#' a pool of graphs.
#' If the result graph is inconsistent, then the pool is made of
#' \emph{max_iteration} graphs from the iterations, otherwise it is made of
#' those graphs in the union.
#' In the consensus graph, an edge is present when the proportion of non-zero
#' status in the pool is above the threshold. For example, if the pool contains
#' [A, B, B, 0, 0], where "A", "B" are different status of the edge and "0"
#' indicates the absence of the edge. Then the edge is set to connected ("1")
#' if the proportion of non-zero status (0.6 in the example) is equal to
#' or higher than \emph{consensus_threshold}. (When set to connected,
#' the orientation of the edge will be further determined by the average
#' probability of orientation.)
#'
#' @param negative_info [a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]
#'
#' For test purpose only. If TRUE, negative shifted mutual information is
#' allowed during the computation when mutual information is inferior to the
#' complexity term.
#' For small dataset with complicated structures, e.g. discrete variables with
#' many levels, allowing for negative shifted mutual information may help
#' identifying weak v-structures related to those discrete variables,
#' as the negative three-point information in those cases will come from
#' the difference between two negative shifted mutual information terms
#' (expected to be negative due to the small sample size).
#' However, under this setting, a v-structure (X -> Z <- Y) in the final graph
#' does not necessarily imply that X is dependent on Y conditioning on Z,
#' As a consequence, the interpretability of the final graph
#' is hindered. In practice, it's advised to keep this parameter as FALSE.
#'
#' @param mode [a string, optional, "S" by default, possible values are
#' "S": Standard (IID samples) or "TS": Temporal Stationary"]
#'
#' When temporal mode is activated, the time information must be provided
#' in the first column of \emph{input_data}. For more details about temporal
#' stationary mode, see Simon \emph{et al.}, eLife reviewed preprint 2024.
#'
#' @param n_layers [an integer, optional, NULL by default, must be >= 2
#' if supplied]
#'
#' Used only in temporal mode, \emph{n_layers} defines the number of layers
#' that will be considered for the variables in the time unfolded graph.
#' The layers will be distant of \emph{delta_t} time steps.
#' If not supplied, the number of layers is estimated from the dynamic of the
#' dataset and the maximum number of nodes \emph{max_nodes} allowed in the
#' final lagged graph.
#'
#' @param delta_t [an integer, optional, NULL by default, must be >= 1
#' if supplied]
#'
#' Used only in temporal mode, \emph{delta_t} defines the number of time steps
#' between each layer.
#' i.e. on 1000 time steps with \emph{n_layers} = 3 and \emph{delta_t} = 7,
#' the time steps kept for the samples conversion will be 1, 8, 15
#' for the first sample, the next sample will use 2, 9, 16 and so on.
#' If not supplied, the number of time steps between layers is estimated
#' from the dynamic of the dataset and the number of layers.
#'
#' @param movavg [an integer, optional, NULL by default, must be >= 2
#' if supplied]
#'
#' Used only in temporal mode. When supplied, a moving average operation is
#' applied to all integer and numeric variables that are not contextual
#' variables.
#'
#' @param keep_max_data [a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]
#'
#' Used only in temporal mode. If TRUE, rows where some NAs have been
#' introduced during the moving averages and lagging will be kept
#' whilst they will be dropped if FALSE.
#'
#' @param max_nodes [an integer, optional, 50 by default]
#'
#' Used only in temporal mode and if the \emph{n_layers} or \emph{delta_t}
#' parameters are not supplied. \emph{max_nodes} is used as the maximum number
#' of nodes in the final graph to compute \emph{n_layers} and/or \emph{delta_t}.
#' The default is 50 to produce quick runs and can be increased up to 200
#' or 300 on recent computers to produce more precise results.
#'
#' @param verbose [a boolean value, optional, FALSE by default]
#'
#' If TRUE, debugging output is printed.
#'
#' @return A \emph{miic-like} object that contains:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item{\emph{all.edges.summary:} a data frame with information about the
#'  relationship between relevant pair of variables.
#'
#'  As returning the information on all possible pairs of variables could lead
#'  to an huge data frame, by convention, the summary does not include pair of
#'  variables not sharing information at all (\emph{I'(x,y) <= 0}).
#'  However, as exception to this convention, when a ground truth is supplied
#'  (using the \emph{true_edges} parameter), the edges that are not retained
#'  by MIIC because the variables does not share information at all
#'  but are present in the true edges will be included in the summary
#'  to report correctly all the false negative edges.
#'
#'  So, the summary contains these categories of edges:
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item{ edges retained}
#'  \item{ edges not retained after contionning on some contributor(s)}
#'  \item{ edges not retained without condionning but present in true edges}
#'  }
#'  while these edges are not considered as relevant and are not included:
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item{ edges not retained without condionning and not in true edges}
#'  }
#'
#'  Information available in the summary are:
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item{ \emph{x:} X node name}
#'  \item{ \emph{y:} Y node name}
#'  \item{ \emph{type:} contains 'N' if the edge has been removed or 'P' for
#'  retained edges. If the true graph is supplied in the \emph{true_edges}
#'  parameter, 'P' becomes 'TP' (True Positive) or 'FP' (False Positive),
#'  while 'N' becomes 'TN' (True Negative) or 'FN' (False Negative).
#'  Note that, as the \emph{all.edges.summary} does not contain all the
#'  removed edges, edges not present have to be considered as 'N'
#'  and, if the true graph is supplied, as 'TN'.}
#'  \item{ \emph{ai:} the contributing nodes found by the method which
#'  participate in the mutual information between \emph{x} and \emph{y},
#'  and possibly separate them.}
#'  \item{ \emph{raw_contributions:} describes the share of total mutual
#'  information between \emph{x} and \emph{y} explained by each contributor,
#'  measured by I'(x;y;ai|{aj}) / I'(x;y),
#'  where {aj} is the separating set before adding ai.}
#'  \item{ \emph{contributions:} describes the share of remaining mutual
#'  information between \emph{x} and \emph{y} explained  by each successive
#'  contributors, measured by I'(x;y;ai|{aj}) / I'(x;y|{aj}),
#'  where {aj} is the separating set before adding ai. }
#'  \item{ \emph{info:} the mutual information \emph{I(x;y)} times the number
#'  of complete samples \emph{n_xy} for the pair (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).}
#'  \item{ \emph{n_xy:} gives the number of complete samples on which the
#'  information without conditioning has been computed. If the input dataset
#'  has no missing value, the number of samples is the same for all pairs
#'  and corresponds to the total number of samples.}
#'  \item{ \emph{info_cond:} the conditional mutual information \emph{I(x;y|ai)}
#'  times the number of complete samples \emph{n_xy_ai} used in the computation.
#'  \emph{info_cond} is equal to \emph{info} when \emph{ai} is an empty set.}
#'  \item{ \emph{cplx:} the complexity term for the pair (\emph{x}, \emph{y})
#'  taking into account the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.}
#'  \item{ \emph{n_xy_ai:} the number of complete samples taking into account
#'  \emph{x}, \emph{y} and all nodes in \emph{ai} on which the
#'  information and the complexity terms are computed.
#'  If the input dataset has no missing value, the number of samples is the
#'  same for all pairs and corresponds to the total number of samples.}
#'  \item{ \emph{info_shifted:} value equal to \emph{info_cond} - \emph{cplx}.
#'  Used to decide whether the edge is retained (when positive),
#'  or removed (when zero or possibly negative when the parameter
#'  \emph{negative_info} is set to TRUE).}
#'  \item{ \emph{ort_inferred:} the orientation of the edge (\emph{x}, \emph{y}).
#'  0: edge removed, 1: un-directed, 2: directed from X to Y, -2: directed
#'  from Y to X, 6: bi-directed.\cr
#'  When the \emph{consistent} option is turned on and there is more than
#'  one graph in the consistent cycle, this is the inferred orientation
#'  of the edge in the last graph in the cycle. }
#'  \item{ \emph{ort_ground_truth:} the orientation of the edge (\emph{x},
#'  \emph{y}) from a given reference graph when true edges are provided.}
#'  \item{ \emph{is_inference_correct:} indicates if the inferred orientation
#'  agrees with the provided ground truth. TRUE: agrees, FALSE: disagrees and
#'  set to NA when no ground truth is supplied.}
#'  \item{ \emph{is_causal:} boolean value indicating the causal nature of the
#'  arrow tips of an edge, based on the probabilities given in the columns
#'  \emph{p_y2x} and \emph{p_x2y}. TRUE: when the edges is directed
#'  and both the head and the tail are set with high probabilities
#'  (adjustable with the \emph{ori_consensus_ratio} parameter),
#'  FALSE otherwise or NA if the edge is not retained.
#'  More formally, an oriented edge is marked as genuine causal when
#'       \eqn{ (1 - p_{head}) / p_{head} < } \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}
#'  and  \eqn{ p_{tail} / (1 - p_{tail}) < } \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}.\cr
#'  A directed edge not marked as genuine causal indicates that only
#'  the head is set with high probability, while the tail probability
#'  is not extreme enough to be either head or tail. In this case,
#'  the edge is undecided between a directed edge (implying causation)
#'  and a bi-directed edge (implying possible latent confounders).\cr
#'  Note that the genuine causality is deducible only when latent variables
#'  are allowed and propagation is not allowed.}
#'  \item{ \emph{ort_consensus:} Not computed (NAs) when
#'  consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
#'  if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
#'  When computed, indicates the consensus orientation of the edge
#'  determined from the consensus skeleton and the \emph{ori_consensus_ratio}
#'  threshold on averaged orientation probabilities over the cycle of graphs.
#'  Possible values are 0: not connected, 1: not oriented, -2 or 2: oriented
#'  and 6: bi-directional (latent variable).}
#'  \item{ \emph{is_causal_consensus:} Not computed (NAs) when
#'  consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
#'  if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
#'  When computed, work in the same way as \emph{is_causal}
#'  but on the consensus graph.}
#'  \item{ \emph{edge_stats:} Not computed (NAs) when
#'  consistency is not activated or, when consistency is on,
#'  if there is only one graph returned (no cycle).
#'  When computed, contains the frequencies of all \emph{ort_inferred}
#'  values present in the cycle of graphs for the edge (\emph{x, y}),
#'  in the format [percentage(orientation)], separated by ";".
#'  e.g. In a cycle of 4 graphs, if an edge is three times marked as 2
#'  (oriented) and one time marked as 1 (un-oriented), edge_stats will
#'  contain "75\%(2);25\%(1)".}
#'  \item{ \emph{sign:} the sign of the partial correlation between variables
#'  \emph{x} and \emph{y}, conditioned on the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.}
#'  \item{ \emph{partial_correlation:} value of the partial correlation for the
#'  edge (\emph{x, y}) conditioned on the contributing nodes \emph{ai}.}
#'  \item{ \emph{p_y2x:} probability of the arrowhead from \emph{y} to \emph{x},
#'  of the inferred orientation, derived from the three-point mutual information
#'  (cf Affeldt & Isambert, UAI 2015 proceedings). NA if the edge is removed.}
#'  \item{ \emph{p_x2y:} probability of the arrowhead from \emph{x} to \emph{y},
#'  of the inferred orientation, derived from the three-point mutual information
#'  (cf Affeldt & Isambert, UAI 2015 proceedings). NA if the edge is removed.}
#'  \item{ \emph{confidence:} computed only when the confidence cut is
#'  activated (see parameters \emph{n_shuffles} and \emph{conf_threshold}),
#'  NA otherwise.
#'  When computed, it corresponds to a measure of the strength of the retained
#'  edges: it is the ratio between the probability to reject the edge
#'  \emph{exp(-info_shifted(x;y|ai))} in the original dataset versus
#'  the mean probability to do the same in \emph{n_shuffles} number
#'  of randomized datasets.}
#'  }
#'  }
#'
#'  \item{\emph{edges:} a data frame with the raw edges output coming from
#'  the C++ core function. This data frame is used internally by MIIC to
#'  produce the summary and contains all pairs of variables (\emph{x, y}). }
#'
#'  \item{\emph{orientations.prob:} this data frame lists the orientation
#'  probabilities of the two edges of all unshielded triples of the
#'  reconstructed network with the structure: node1 -- mid-node -- node2:
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item{ \emph{node1:} node at the end of the unshielded triplet}
#'  \item{ \emph{p1:} probability of the arrowhead node1 <- mid-node}
#'  \item{ \emph{p2:} probability of the arrowhead node1 -> mid-node}
#'  \item{ \emph{mid-node:} node at the center of the unshielded triplet}
#'  \item{ \emph{p3:} probability of the arrowhead mid-node <- node2}
#'  \item{ \emph{p4:} probability of the arrowhead mid-node -> node2}
#'  \item{ \emph{node2:} node at the end of the unshielded triplet}
#'  \item{ \emph{ni3:} 3 point (conditional) mutual information * N}
#'  \item{ \emph{conflict:} indicates if there a conflict between the
#'  computed probabilities and the NI3 value}
#'  }
#'  }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{adj_matrix:} the adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to
#'  represent the inferred graph. The entries of the matrix indicate whether
#'  pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph. The matrix can be read
#'  as a (row, column) set of couples where the row represents the source node
#'  and the column the target node. Since miic can reconstruct mixed networks
#'  (including directed, undirected and bidirected edges), we will have a
#'  different digit for each case:
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item{ 1: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is un-directed}
#'  \item{ 2: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is directed as \emph{x} -> \emph{y} }
#'  \item{ -2: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is directed as \emph{x} <- \emph{y} }
#'  \item{ 6: (\emph{x}, \emph{y}) edge is bi-directed}
#'  }
#'  }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{proba_adj_matrix:} the probability adjacency matrix is
#'  a square matrix used to represent the orientation probabilities associated
#'  to the edges tips. The value at ("row", "column") is the probability,
#'  for the edge between "row" and "column" nodes, of the edge tip on the "row"
#'  side. A probability less than 0.5 is an indication of a possible tail
#'  (cause) and a probability greater than 0.5 a possible head (effect). }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{adj_matrices:} present only when consistency is activated.
#'  The list of the adjacency matrices, one for each graph
#'  which is part of the resulting cycle of graphs.
#'  Each item is a square matrix with the same layout as \emph{adj_matrix}. }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{proba_adj_matrices:} present only when consistency is activated.
#'  The list of the probability adjacency matrices, one for each graph
#'  which is part of the resulting cycle of graphs. Each item is a
#'  square matrix with the same layout as \emph{proba_adj_matrix}. }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{proba_adj_average:} present only when consistency is activated.
#'  The average probability adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to
#'  represent the orientation probabilities associated to the edges tips
#'  of the consensus graph. Its layout is the same as \emph{proba_adj_matrix}
#'  and it contains the averaged probability of edges tips over the resulting
#'  cycle of graphs. }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{is_consistent:} present only when consistency is activated.
#'  TRUE if the returned graph is consistent, FALSE otherwise. }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{time:} execution time of the different steps and total run-time
#'  of the causal graph reconstruction by MIIC. }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{interrupted:} TRUE if causal graph reconstruction has been
#'  interrupted, FALSE otherwise. }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{scores:} present only when true edges have been supplied.
#'  Contains the scores of the returned graph in regard of the ground truth:
#'  \itemize{
#'  \item{ \emph{tp}: number of edges marked as True Positive }
#'  \item{ \emph{fp}: number of edges marked as False Positive }
#'  \item{ \emph{fn}: number of edges marked as False Negative }
#'  \item{ \emph{precision}: Precision }
#'  \item{ \emph{recall}: Recall }
#'  \item{ \emph{fscore}: F1-Score }
#'  }
#'  }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{params:} the list of parameters used for the network
#'  reconstruction. The parameters not supplied are initialized to their default
#'  values. Otherwise, the parameters are checked and corrected if necessary. }
#'
#'  \item {\emph{state_order:} the state order used for the network
#'  reconstruction. If no state order is supplied, it is generated by using
#'  default values. Otherwise, it is the state order checked and corrected
#'  if necessary.}
#'
#'  \item {\emph{black_box:} present only if a black box has been supplied,
#' the black box, checked and corrected if necessary, used for the network
#' reconstruction.}
#'
#'  \item {\emph{true_edges:} present only if the true edges have been supplied,
#' the true edges, checked and corrected if necessary, used for the network
#' evaluation.}
#'
#'  \item {\emph{tmiic:} present only in temporal mode.
#'  Named list containing the full list of edges completed by stationarity,
#'  the lagged state order and, if a black box or true edges have been supplied,
#'  the lagged versions of these inputs.}
